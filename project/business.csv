While BSE Sensex slipped around 300 points, Nifty50 was near 22,200. At 9:19 AM, BSE Sensex was trading at 73,253.25, down 259 points or 0.35%. Nifty50 was at 22,219.05, down 83 points or 0.37%.The Indian stock market experienced a volatile session on Tuesday, with domestic indices opening higher but failing to sustain the gains and closing in the red.Market analysts attributed this fluctuation to investor caution amid the ongoing corporate earnings season and the Lok Sabha elections. Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal, expects this volatile trend to persist until the exit poll results provide more clarity.""Although Nifty opens positive, it is witnessing resistance at higher levels, indicating cautiousness among the investors with the progress of both the result season and the Lok Sabha election. We expect this volatile move to continue till the Exit poll. Hence market to remain in a broader range until clarity emerges,"" said Khemka.Technical analyst Nagaraj Shetti from HDFC Securities, believes that the market needs to confirm the higher bottom reversal with an upside bounce from the lows. The immediate resistance level is pegged at 22,400, while the next lower support levels to watch are around 22,100-22,000.In the global markets , US stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average clinging onto gains, extending their recent winning streaks fueled by expectations of US Federal Reserve rate cuts this year.Asian shares struggled for direction following the sluggish US session, with investors divided on the market's ability to sustain the current rally given economic uncertainties. Oil prices fell in early Asian trading hours on Wednesday after data from the American Petroleum Institute showed an increase in US crude and fuel stockpiles, indicating weak demand. The US dollar made modest gains, while the Japanese yen eased towards the 155 per dollar level, keeping intervention risks from Tokyo high.","BSE Sensex slipped around 300 points, Nifty50 was near 22,200.

This notice - under section 142(1) - seeking information, is issued when a taxpayer has not filed the tax return or is issued to seek additional preliminary information regarding a particular detail - say bank interest or long-term capital gains/loss on sale of a property.This guidance is part of a comprehensive set of guidelines issued recently by the Central Board of Direct Taxes for compulsory selection of I-T returns for the purpose of complete scrutiny.These guidelines, which are issued annually, pertain to the selection and complete scrutiny that is to be undertaken during the current financial year and cover survey cases, search and seizure cases, tax evasion cases, cases where no I-T return was filed in response to an inquiry notice under section 142(1).It also covers cases relating to non-registration or cancellation of registration under various sections - such as 12A/12AB relating to registration of charitable organisations to be eligible for tax benefit.

Meet the Apple executives who could succeed Tim Cook,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/meet-the-apple-executives-who-could-succeed-tim-cook/articleshow/109964254.cms,"Tim Cook picked up the mantle from Steve Jobs as CEO of Apple over a decade ago and grew it into a multi-trillion dollar company. Now, as Cook nears traditional retirement age, speculation abounds about who will succeed him.Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman joins host David Gura to discuss the challenges of replacing Cook, his potential successors and how that decision will impact one of the best-known brands in the world.Here is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation:David Gura: Every year, the top executives at Apple – of course, one of the largest and most influential companies in the world – are whisked away to an idyllic retreat usually in Carmel Valley.That’s about 90 miles south of the company’s headquarters, in Cupertino, California. So, many of these execs travel by bus.Mark Gurman: They can't bring their family, they can't bring their assistants. These are the 100 most important people at Apple.Gura: Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has covered Apple for almost 15 years, and he says this annual meeting is one of the most important dates on the company’s calendar.It’s something Steve Jobs started.Gurman: They sit in auditoriums, different rooms of this beautiful resort in Northern California. They are taught and shown all of the goodness that's to come from Apple in the years to come.Gura: It was at this retreat that Apple’s so-called “Top 100” got a first look at the original iPad, Mark says.They saw the MacBook Air and the Apple Watch. And got updates on the Apple Car project, which the company just scrapped.Gurman: This is where you go to learn about Apple's future.Gura: And while most of the focus is on product presentations – and prototypes, Apple’s senior leaders are also taking note of who among them has been picked to make these presentations.Gurman: I think the people at that event are probably always naturally trying to figure out who's next in line. Who's in charge?Gura: That is … who will eventually replace Tim Cook.Jobs’ hand-picked successor has been the CEO of Apple for nearly thirteen years. He was Jobs’ deputy before that.Gura: At Apple, succession planning is the elephant in the room, and even though Cook hasn’t indicated he plans to leave the company anytime soon, Mark says there is growing speculation about when that’ll happen who will be its next chief executive – and whether that person is in this group of Apple’s most important people.Gurman: We’re nearing sort of the end of Cook’s tenure at Apple, probably, right? He's going to turn 65 next year. He's older than most CEOs in the S&P 500. He's been at Apple for 25 years and Apple's at a precarious position because the executive team where they likely would choose their next CEO from most of the people on that executive team are all about 60 years old, or would probably be in their mid to late sixties by the time Tim Cook retires, leaving the company with very few reasonable options.Gura: Today on the show:The challenges of finding someone who could do one of the most demanding jobs in business.Who’s in the running, and how that decision will impact a $2.8 trillion company, and one of the best-known brands in the world.I’m David Gura, and this is The Big Take, from Bloomberg News.Gura: Tim Cook has been the CEO of Apple for more than a decade.And part of his job involves planning for who will succeed him. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says it's not the easiest job to fill.Gura: Is that job description really well fleshed out? In other words, what does an Apple CEO need to be able to do?Gurman: An Apple CEO needs to either be the visionary to bring new products to market. Or needs to be able to find who the visionary is and partner with that visionary to bring those new products to market.Gura: It’s a challenge that wasn’t lost on Steve Jobs when he tapped Cook for the job.Gurman: You know, the thing about Cook is that it is all consuming, and I think one of the reasons that Jobs made him the CEO, other than the fact that he was the most qualified, probably by a long shot, amongst the executive team at the time, is that Jobs knew how all consuming the next era of Apple would be, right?And Tim's entire life for the most part, based on everyone who knows him and everyone you speak to about him is Apple.Gura: Cook became Apple’s CEO in 2011, under intense scrutiny.He took over for Jobs, the company’s founder, who was battling pancreatic cancer.And in October of that year, Cook stepped into the spotlight, to unveil a new version of the iPhone :Tim Cook: Good morning. This is my first product launch since being named CEO. I'm sure you didn't know that.Gura: You can hear him cracking a joke to acknowledge what a big moment this was. He was under immense pressure – following in Jobs’ footsteps.Cook: I Love Apple. And I consider it the privilege of a lifetime to have worked here for almost 14 years.Gura: As Apple’s chief operating officer, Cook worked side-by-side with Jobs, during a period when Apple grew at breakneck speed. When it became much more than a computer company.Cook: Just ten years ago, we launched the original iPod here, and it went on to revolutionize the way we listen to music.Gura: Mark, you covered that transition in 2011. What can you tell us about the relationship between Steve Jobs and Tim Cook?Gurman: They were close. I wouldn't say that they were best friends. Uh, I would say in many ways they were, uh, partners. Steve Jobs was the design mind. He was the person dreaming up these new products, and Tim Cook was the execution guy. He was the person for all intents and purposes, who was able to bring these products to market, get them manufactured, get them into retail stores, and so forth. And then when Steve Jobs stepped down and then ultimately passed away, what Apple lost was sort of that visionary to dream up new types of product categories, new designs, new user experiencesGura: Jobs died on October 5th, 2011 – one day after Cook unveiled that new iPhone.And in the years that followed, Cook made sure Apple continued to build on the runaway success of that device.Gurman: The Apple watch for all intents and purposes is an accessory or an extension of the iPhone. Airpods are an extension to the iPhone, an accessory to the iPhone. What Tim Cook has done, he's taken the product lines that Steve Jobs created and envisioned, and supercharged them. When Steve Jobs passed, there was only one iPad model, the iPad 2.Today, there are five, or even more iPad models available right now. The iPhone went from one or two different models to several different models. So what Tim Cook has been able to do is squeeze so much juice out of the lemons that are those original Apple form factors.Gura: Under his leadership, Apple added products and services, along with new accessories.The company branched into movies and TV.It introduced an Apple credit card.Gurman: At its core, I think Apple is still very much a technology company, but they like to position themselves as well as a lifestyle company.Gura: Now, more than a decade into his tenure, do you see this company as Tim Cook's Apple, or is it still Steve Jobs’ Apple that, that Tim Cook is the steward of?Gurman: I think it's actually a mix of both. At its very core, Steve Jobs left Apple with something, you know, more than pretty good in the iPhone. And Tim Cook, I would say, has probably made the most of what he was left with. I don't think anyone could have done a better job following in the footsteps as legendary as someone like Steve Jobs.Gura: People worried Steve Jobs would be irreplaceable, but now, there’s a sense Tim Cook’s shoes will be hard to fill.Gurman: So The question is Apple moving forward, who was that new person to lead Apple into a new era with a new vision, with new types of products. And that's really what Apple needs to come up with to create its next 15 years.Gura: There are a handful of names that come up in conversations about CEO succession at Apple.But over the years, as Mark has reported on this, there’s been a clear frontrunner.Gurman: He can own the stage. He can talk the talk with government officials from China to Europe to the US. If something happened unexpectedly to Cook, I don't think Apple would miss a beat.Gura: So, who is Apple’s heir apparent? And who else is waiting in the wings, vying for the top job? That’s after the break.Gura: Before Tim Cook became Apple’s CEO, he was the chief operating officer under Steve Jobs.And when it comes to who will replace Cook, his current COO could easily be next in line:Cook: And to tell us about some progress in this area, I'd like to invite up Jeff Williams. Jeff?Gura: That’s Cook introducing Jeff Williams at a product launch in 2016:Williams: Last year, we introduced Research Kit. And our goal was to use technology to solve some of the biggest problemsGura: Williams has been C-O-O for almost a decade now. He joined the company in 1998.Gurman: Right now, he runs Apple's entire operations. He's in charge of the Apple supply chain.He's in charge of Apple's health care efforts. He's in charge of Apple watch hardware and software engineering. He was in charge of the Apple car. He's involved with the Apple vision pro headset, and he's in charge of Apple's hardware and software design organization. So he has so much in his portfolio already, and he would be able to be a shoo-in pretty easily for Cook if something were to happen.A lot of people have called him Tim Cook's Tim Cook.Gura: And like Cook, Williams grew up in the South, he got an MBA from Duke, and had a stint at IBM before joining Apple.But there’s something else these two have in common. They’re both in their early sixties.Gurman: He’s only two years younger than Cook.Gura: And that could make William’s path to succeeding Cook complicated.Gurman: If Cook retires in three to five years, you can't name a 66 year old Jeff Williams as CEO of Apple. Right? The Street, the market, the employees, the board, probably wouldn't be terribly fond of that idea. You can't set up someone for a two to five year tenure as a new CEO of a company as big and as important as Apple.Gura: This is not just an issue with Williams, though.When you go down the list of other potential candidates among Apple’s top management, a trend emerges.Mark says many members of the company’s leadership team are also hovering around retirement age.And turnover at the executive level is pretty rare.Gurman: When you're a Senior Vice President at Apple, you're essentially the CEO of a major division, right? You're at one of the most successful companies in the world. You're also getting paid $25 million per year as an Apple Senior Vice President. So from a financial standpoint, it's very worthwhile to stay around. But I think the people in Apple's executive team, they're motivated by more than money. I think there's a sense that a lot of these folks are very much motivated by the power that comes with being in that role. And so power is sometimes hard to give up.Gura: Mark says, if it’s not Williams, there are a few other candidates who are likely in the running.They’re all currently on the Apple payroll. Tim Cook himself has said he hopes the board taps someone from within the company. And they have their own trade-offs.Finding a single person who can do everything that an Apple CEO needs to do is a real challenge.One potential candidate is on his second stint at Apple:Gurman: Craig Federighi, who's in charge of software engineering.Gura: But, Mark says?Gurman: Federighi probably doesn't have the business acumen to run the whole company.Gura: There’s also Deirdre O'Brien, who oversees Apple’s sprawling retail operation worldwide.Gurman: And before that, Uh, she was one of the company's top executives on operations and sales.Gura: But according to Mark? ...Gurman: Apple probably wants to try something new for a new era and not go with another operations or an HR person.Gura: But Mark has identified another candidate. Who, with his age and experience, is a strong contender.Gurman: Everything that I have learned while reporting the story points to a guy named John Ternus.He is not even 50 years old. He's Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Engineering.He joined Apple's executive team in 2021. He has quickly risen through the ranks. He used to be a VP in charge of Mac computer engineering. He eventually added the iPad, added AirPods. More recently, he added the iPhone and the Apple watch. And now he's in charge of basically all of the money making hardware for Apple.And he's become an increasingly important face at the company. He's been increasingly promoted in their marketing. He's dealing with regulators in terms of right to repair laws. So he's becoming a bigger part of the Apple story.Gura: Mark says Ternus had a marquee role this year, at that annual executive conference in Northern California.And just this week, Apple unveiled some new tech, and Cook called on Ternus at that event to introduce those new products to the public.Tim Cook: So here's John to tell you more. …John Ternus: Let's kick things off with iPad Air.Gura: Mark says Ternus’ prospects of becoming Apple’s next CEO get better the longer Cook sticks around.And there is no indication he plans to retire anytime soon.Executives are not under the same pressure they used to be, to retire in their mid-Sixties.Gura: Mark, I wonder if you could situate this conversation in kind of a broader cultural sea change we're seeing. Bob Iger back at Disney in his 70s. That must in some way sort of liberate Tim Cook to look perhaps at a longer tenure at Apple.Gurman: Yeah, that's a very good point. Certainly the next U. S. president is going to be in their 80s during their tenure. You have Pat Gelsinger, who's the CEO of Intel. He was named to that role three years ago when he was about 60. So certainly you do have some older statesmen there with Tim Cook, you know, one of the, the, the older ones and Apple appreciates, as some people tell me, the people with gray hair there, that means they have experience and wisdom, and they've been around the block a few times. There is nothing that Tim Cook hasn't seen, and wisdom goes a long way for being an Apple executive.Gura: For his part, Cook has a lot of unfinished business he’s attending to right now:Apple’s seen a slowdown in sales, the company is taking hits from regulators – in the US and the European Union, and after Apple’s adventure in automobile manufacturing came to a screeching halt, it’s under pressure to deliver something new.All of that, and more, is on Cook’s plate, and Mark says no one is pushing him to step aside.Gurman: There's no mandatory retirement age. And I would say that even if there was, uh, they'd rip that up or shred it or light it on fire to let Cook stay around as long as he wants to. Because he's been effective, Wall Street loves him. The stock price has surely been positively reflected by Cook's tenure.And so I think Tim Cook is going to be the CEO of Apple as long as he wants to be the CEO of Apple and he won't step down a day before that.",Tim Cook has been the CEO of Apple for more than a decade.

Legacy companies cornered bulk of PE-VC investments in 2023 due to their established business models.The investments have been largely led by PE funds that have been more inclined to back legacy firms. Over the years, PE funds have also actively evaluated deals in new age tech firms and invested in companies in the space - Dream11, Sugar are among startups that have been backed by PE investors like TPG and L Catterton.Last year, 75% of PE-VC investments flowed into traditional sectors like healthcare, retail, energy and advanced manufacturing against 60% in 2022, a report by Bain & Co showed.While investments in healthcare hit a record high of $5.5 billion in 2023, a series of PE investments into Reliance's retail unit shored up the share of consumer deals. Typically, VCs invest largely in startups, which entails more risk. PEs, however, tend to invest more in established companies.Although a slowdown in VC funding took the total count of PE-VC investments to $39 billion in 2023 from $62 billion in 2022, India's share of PE-VC investments in Asia-Pacific has grown over the past five years alongside Japan. China's share declined to 31% in 2023 from 55% in 2018.""Favourable policies in India such as production-linked incentives, export promotion initiatives, and customs duty rationalisation drove some shift in economic activity and subsequent investments to India.....global firms diversified production outside China,"" analysts at the firm said.Even as analysts have flagged sluggish global GDP growth and geopolitical tensions in West Asia as risks to investor appetite, which may lead to cautious deployment of capital in 2024 as well, the overall tally may be better than the previous year. Investments in 2024 continue to see green shoots over 2023, Sai Deo, partner at Bain & Co told TOI. ""India as a centre within Asia-Pacific is becoming important,"" Deo said.Last week, TOI had reported that several global and domestic PE and VC funds have raised new funds and are scouting for investments. Share of domestic funds in India has steadily grown, increasing their share of PE investments by 2.5 times over the past four years. ""This trend has been accompanied by a significant expansion of India-based teams by PE funds, growing roughly twofold over 2019-23.""Leading global funds are planning to ramp up capital allocation to India"", analysts at Bain said, adding that players such as KKR and Blackstone entered new asset classes like growth and private credit over 2021-23.",Legacy companies cornered bulk of PE-VC investments in 2023 due to their established business models.

The finance minister set the stage for a ""Viksit Bharat by 2047"", on the core principles of ‘Sabka Saath’, ‘Sabka Vikas’, ‘Sabka Vishwas’, with ‘Sabka Prayas’ being added as a new theme in the interim Budget.This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data i.e., farmer welfare and N for Nari utthan i.e., support for women entrepreneurs.These form the pillars of a comprehensive inclusive development. The Government's commitment to sustainable development under the strategy for Amrit Kaal includes achieving 'Net Zero' by 2070, rooftop solarization for one crore households and robust health initiatives.The Indian economy's resilience takes center stage amidst positive indicators of declining current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, falling unemployment rates, and a notable rise in digital transactions. These statistics affirm the robustness of the economy, showcasing a trajectory of growth and stability.The achievements in taxation reforms are nothing short of remarkable, with direct tax collections more than trebling in the last decade, the number of tax return filers increasing by 2.4 times, average processing time of tax returns plummeting from 93 days in FY 2013-14 to an impressive 10 days in FY 2023-24, resulting in issuance of quick refunds. These are the results of consistent progressive measures thus obviating the need for, and rightly avoiding, any last-minute populist measures.No change in existing tax rates, both for direct and indirect taxes, is a good indicator of stability and predictability for investors and taxpayers.A welcome move to waive outstanding tax demands that are minor, disputed, and unreconciled. This involves the withdrawal of outstanding direct tax demands up to Rs. 25,000 pertaining to the period up to FY 2009-10 and up to Rs.10,000 for FY 2010-11 to 2014-15.The Government's commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment is evident in its intent to extend specific tax benefits for start-ups, investments by sovereign wealth funds/ pension funds, and certain IFSC units. The extension has been made now until March 31, 2025. This might help in creating a conducive landscape for business.To align with the CBDT notification issued earlier, the provisions relating to tax collection at source concerning remittances under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme have now been formally incorporated in the Finance Bill, 2024, setting the rate at 20% for amounts exceeding Rs. 7 lakhs in a financial year.The Finance Bill, 2024 proposes an extension of the time limit for introducing the faceless scheme by the Central Government for transfer pricing proceedings, DRP Proceedings, and ITAT Proceedings, up to March 31, 2025.The interim Budget 2024 may not have proposed significant tax announcements, but it very well positioned the prelude to the full budget post the upcoming elections. Considering the potential impact on the population across the four pillars of GYAN, a sizable portion of India stands to be covered. The interim Budget’s focus on the tax front resembles a report card, highlighting the maturity achieved by our tax system. The enhancement of taxpayer services was emphasized as a key priority.","This Budget's four core strategic areas came as GYAN: G for Garib Kalyan, Y for Youth empowerment, A for Anna-data and N for Nari utthan.

Interim Budget for a Viksit Bharat: It’s for everyone and all,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/interim-budget-for-a-viksit-bharat-its-for-everyone-and-all/articleshow/107497439.cms,"By Akhilesh Tuteja

The Finance Minister on February 01, 2024, delivered a truly innovative interim budget. At first glance, it did not seem like an interim budget but looked more like the budget to drive further growth and a continuum of inclusive growth-oriented investments.At the outset, this budget brings a wonderful balance between fiscal prudence and continued investment for growth.It's not easy to continue the glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit and continuing to make significant investments in all areas including infrastructure, R&D, energy transition, technology, skilling, and social welfare. The surprising reduction in fiscal deficit of 5.8% as against the budgeted 5.9% for FY24 and the projection of 5.1% in FY25 with a clear focus on increasing investments was a huge positive.This was a budget for everyone and all because it caters to every part of the Indian economy and society. The FM has carefully catered to the investment needs of various sectors. The continued focus on youth, impoverished, women and farmers to increase their involvement and contribution to economic growth is evident. By committing an 11.1% increase in capital expenditure to 11,11,111 lakh crore, the FM has clearly brought every single 1 in this growth journey.What was very impressive was the inclusion strategy of the government. The focus on women's empowerment for the past few years is unprecedented, which is reflected in the inclusion of women in the workforce moving from 23.3% to 37% in the last five years. The thirty crore Mudra Yojna loans to women entrepreneurs were a great boost to the Nari Shakti initiative. We already have over 10 million Lakhpati Didis and what is truly evident is like a corporate CFO, the FM has revised the earlier target of 20 million Lakhpati Didis to 30 million. The government also plans to invest in initiatives to encourage young girls between the ages of 9 and 14 to undertake the vaccination for cervical cancer which is again a great boost to Nari Shakti.A lot needs to be done to bring more women into all parts of economic growth but the journey so far and the vision of the future is truly inspiring.While India continues on its technological prowess and makes its mark in new technologies like Artificial Intelligence, we need a multi-pronged strategy to harness the power of AI. We need a clear focus on building AI systems in India so that we not only emerge as a global leader in this new era but can build models, which are specific to India that will benefit Indians. At the same time, we need a very wide coverage program to build skills to leverage AI to its fullest potential. The biggest contribution we can make to the inclusion of youth in the economic development of the country is by skilling them in new skill areas. In the last few years, the Skill India Mission has trained 14 million youth, reskilled over 5 million youth and established a staggering 3,000 new ITIs. The future of any country will depend as much on capital investments as on skill investments.The focus on agricultural development and support to the farmer continues through direct financial assistance to farmers. The farmers have benefited by getting crop insurance through PM Fasal Bima Yojana. It's not just the farmers, the PM-SVANidhi provides credit assistance to a large number of street vendors.The last few years have seen the journey of affordable housing through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). There is a slight increase in allocation to launch a scheme for encouraging the middle class to build or buy new homes. This investment will likely propel a wider economic development and increase employment.India has seen a tremendous rise in entrepreneurship in the last few years. In order to continue the journey and promote new startups, the government proposes to extend certain tax benefits, which are expiring from March 2024 to March 2025. The MSMEs have not been left behind. With a proposal to provide timely finances to such enterprises, the government has paved the way for their growth, so they can look to compete globally.All in all, it’s a truly inclusive budget with a clear focus on development not just by giving away freebies but enabling the people to participate in the economic development activity. While the FM calls the comprehensive GDP - Governance, Development & Performance – to me, this budget is inclusive of another GDP – gender, demography, and professions.","Akhilesh Tuteja is Partner and Head, Clients and Markets, KPMG in India.

‘Enough domestic sources of demand to counter drag from external sector’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/enough-domestic-sources-of-demand-to-counter-drag-from-external-sector/articleshow/107372012.cms,"Do you think the

creates room for lower interest rates?

One of the issues that the Budget has flagged is the demographic challenge and opportunity and the societal change that is taking place. How do you view this?

Niti Aayog is working on the Viksit Bharat roadmap. What will be the focus areas?

You are as much a representative of the Centre as well as the states. Is it time to revisit the entire formula for transfers to states particularly on the issue of cesses and surcharges?

Suman Bery , who heads Niti Aayog , the govt think tank, is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China, which he says is also an opportunity for India. The economist is confident that Indian states remain resilient. Excerpts of the interview with TOI.The finance ministry expects the economy to grow 7% next year.Given the global situation, how do you see the prospects?The belief in the finance ministry is that we have a possible drag coming from the external sector but that we have other sources. We have enough domestic sources of demand. One has to applaud the political and economic judgment of FM in deciding that it was appropriate to pursue the path of fiscal consolidation. There is transparency. What this actually reflects is responsible economic management, which is one reason we are where we are. Second, it also creates a buffer so that there is policy space if we do encounter headwinds.That’s the hope and expectation. We have an independent central bank and an inflation targeting central bank, so it is up to the monetary policy committee to take a call through the monetary policy committee on the repo rate .The PM has said that when India grows its states grow. India is a composite of 37 states and UTs. They are each at very different points in their demographic transition. There are some states where the net replacement rate is down to 1%, like Kerala . There are others, particularly UP and Bihar, which are in their earliest stage of demographic transition and each one of these states is the size of a large European country. There are two implications of that — one is internal labour mobility and it will become an even larger part of our growth model. The govt has taken several steps to create a unified market. Our main endowment is our human capital and that has to be equipped to participate in global exchange in many ways. We know from China, Japan that the demographic dividend partly depends on markets and on human capital. But the golden period is fairly short lived, about 15 years, when the so called dependency ratio declines. The other big opportunity the PM has been highlighting is bringing women much more into the active labour force.When Niti was set up there was the idea of a three-year vision and a seven-year strategy paper. The reality is that schemes of govt tend to be aligned with the award of the Finance Commission . There are various established building blocks or hand holds which are already a matter of govt policy. The PM is much more interested in a national debate on what it means to be a Viksit Bharat or modern society. We have a collective goal and it is for the democratic polity to define what that goal should be. Its emphatically not for a super mandarin bureaucracy. It is not going to be Lee Kwan Yew’s Singapore led from the top.It’s entirely a finance ministry matter but I would be lying if I didn’t say when I visit certain states there is this complaint. A big frontier would be resource mobilisation at the state level. Second is going to be rationalisation of subsidies not only at the Union level, but also at the state level. All chief ministers sit on my governing council. When they convene as the governing council, I see them in their role as development practitioners. The world is beginning to appreciate quite how much institutional and political maturity India attained in our 75 years and the most fundamental dimension of a democracy, we have orderly transfers of power. There are enough buffers to ensure that what happens in state finances is unlikely to create macro instability. Those risks are well contained by our Constitution. The chief ministers know that they are going to be judged by development outcomes and so you can have the sugar rush of changing of pension plans or various handouts but if the cupboard is bare you are not going to be able to deliver.","Suman Bery is bullish on India’s growth prospects against the backdrop of risks, including a slowing China.

Government's Marathon to 2047: Emphasis on Fiscal Prudence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/budget/governments-marathon-to-2047-emphasis-on-fiscal-prudence/articleshow/107371788.cms,"What was the thinking behind keeping the vote on account absolutely straight?

So is it the idea to keep the Budget completely transparent?

The capex has risen 11.1% and there is an emphasis on infrastructure spending. But there is also the hope that the private sector will now take over and start capital spending. Given the geopolitical situation, how confident is the govt that it will pan out as planned?

Finance secretary T V Somanathan, in an interview with TOI, says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047 . Excerpts:If you see the Budget speech you will see the emphasis on 2047. The govt has set its sight on running that marathon.Running to 2047 is a marathon , it’s not a sprint. If you are going to run a marathon, you need to be in good shape and you can’t have short-term stimulants or something that will get you some yards and then it’s done.The whole focus is on making India a developed country by 2047, for which a healthy present and a strong fiscal position is an important concomitant. Some purely short term measures don’t really fit into that picture. It’s a consistent picture: focus on the long term for which you need to build strength in the short term and that needs to be done by prudence in fiscal policy and by not doing things which can detract you from that path. Not doing the wrong thing is more important than appearing to do things.The idea is that govt finances may be good, bad or indifferent depending on the times, depending on the circumstances, depending on the policies. But what is the position should be reflected as reasonably and accurately as possible. That is an emphasis. As regards the Finance Commission, again the terms of reference that have been given to them are the terms in the Constitution.What is the means by which the devolution should be done is a matter they have full discretion. They can actually take all kinds of factors into account and in a sense we felt this time based on my review of the previous commissions that the right expression would be less is more. The shorter, less prescriptive terms of reference gives full scope for all stakeholders including state govts to express their viewpoints and for the commission to take a balanced view of the different perspectives and then come to its award. Ultimately the award of the Finance Commission is about devolution and grant for which full scope has now been given to them.n There are incipient signs of private capital expenditure accelerating. There are some surveys I have seen done by some of the chambers industry, which show high levels of investment. The PMI, which is a sort of leading indicator, is also looking pretty healthy. Capacity utilisation is one reason that private sector capital expenditure doesn’t immediately pick up when the economy starts accelerating because there is surplus capacity.But increasingly I get the sense that many industries are beginning to reach levels where they have to add capacity. When that happens capital investment will happen. Another pointer also mentioned in the Budget speech you may notice that our airlines have placed large orders for planes — that is capital expenditure.When you import 1,000 aircraft, it’s just not 1,000 aircraft, there are concomitant additions to ground handling facilities, you need airports to expand, you need to employ people to do that. That means a lot of jobs. The aircraft is capital but then look at the effect it is going to have on skilled jobs. So capital expenditure is happening. I am fairly confident that we will have decent capital expenditure in the year to come and that will become a new source of acceleration.",Finance secretary T V Somanathan says the Interim Budget has laid the roadmap for the country to emerge as a developed country by 2047.

Income Tax Changes Budget 2024 : In the recent Budget 2024 speech, the Finance Minister kept the Section 80C tax deduction limit unchanged. The maximum limit for claiming tax benefits under Section 80C remains at Rs 1.5 lakh for the current fiscal year 2023-24 and will stay the same for individuals looking to save on taxes through Section 80C investments in the upcoming fiscal year 2024-25.Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions. Individuals can reduce their gross taxable income by up to Rs 1.5 lakh per financial year by engaging in these specific investments or expenditures.You can save on taxes through Section 80C by investing in things like Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds, National Savings Certificate (NSC), and 5-year tax-saving fixed deposits with banks or post offices. Additionally, paying life insurance policy premiums also qualifies for tax benefits under Section 80C.It is important to note that each eligible investment comes with its specific maximum limit, rate of return, liquidity, and taxation rules for the earned returns, states ET in a report. For instance, the most you can invest in PPF in a financial year is Rs 1.5 lakh. Meanwhile, there's no limit on the amount you can invest in ELSS mutual funds, but the Section 80C deduction is capped at Rs 1.5 lakh.If individuals can't make specific investments, they can still get deductions under Section 80C from their gross taxable income through certain expenses. These expenses include repaying the principal amount of a home loan, tuition fees for children, payment of stamp duty, registration fees, and other costs related to buying a house.Since the financial year 2020-21, individuals without any business income must annually choose between the old and new tax regimes. As of the fiscal year 2023-24, the new tax regime is the default option. Consequently, individuals seeking tax deductions under Section 80C must opt for the old tax regime since this deduction isn't available in the new tax regime. It's crucial for taxpayers to be aware of these rules to make informed decisions about their tax planning and investment strategies.","Section 80C of the Income-tax Act lists different investments and expenses eligible for tax deductions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget which is an interim budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year. The budget talks about inclusive development both, social and geographical, especially for youth, women, farmers, and the poor. Continued focus on improving logistics through infrastructure spend on roads, rail, airports, ports increases productivity for companies and citizens alike.To make ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047, the government’s focus is on improving and empowering people’s capabilities through various skilling initiatives. It is encouraging to see that Skill India Mission has succeeded in training more than 1.4 crore youth and upskilling and reskilling 54 lakh youth. I am particularly happy to see the continued focus on youth and women entrepreneurship and the announcement of a new fund which will give interest free 50 year loans for startups will provide a domestic fillip to startups supplementing venture capital we have traditionally relied on from abroad.PM Mudra Yojana has sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to 22.5 lakh crore to youth entrepreneurs and thirty crore Mudra Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. There are several other schemes like Fund of Funds, Start-Up India, and Start-Up Credit Guarantee schemes that are assisting our youth. Further, the extension of tax benefits to Start-ups and investments made by sovereign wealth funds/pension funds, till 31st March 2025 depicts the government’s effort to support the startup eco- system.This aligns quite well with India Sanitation Coalition’s efforts to give impetus to the start-up world. Over the past 7 editions of our ISC-FICCI Sanitation Awards, we have recognized and promoted several start-ups in the sanitation space, many of whom are successful businesses now!While the finance minister did not provide detailed information on Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), the budget allocation sees a slight increase in spend demonstrating continued focus on this highly successful program. The acknowledgement that the private sector has increasingly played a substantial role in addressing WASH issues in both urban and rural areas, with numerous projects underway through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), highlights the government's commitment to addressing challenges in this sector.A perfect example is the LightHouse Initiative initiated by the Department of Drinking Water along with the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC) by partnering with major corporates across India to develop model villages in Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) under SBM-Grameen. From this budget, there is an expectation that the government will persist in prioritizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) as the path toward achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). Additionally, it is hoped that the government will uphold its commitment to making necessary infrastructural investments for SLWM.The budget speech rightly celebrates the fact that we have 83 lakh SHGs and 9 crore women beneficiaries. The microfinance movement in the country and the possibility of empowering women members of SHGs through livelihood skilling is a key to bringing women into mainstream economic advancement.The focus on green growth, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, e-vehicles all help with our green energy thrust. The tourism sector was mentioned and could be a huge job provider for youth and women.Guided by the principle ‘Reform, Perform, and Transform’, the budget emphasizes efficient implementation of various policies by improving coordination with states and relevant stakeholders. This is critical both for infra spend and social programsIt is noteworthy that ISC’s Climate Resilient Coastal Cities project which is being implemented in PPP (Public-Private Partnership) mode in four coastal states of Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa and Maharashtra is congruent with the government’s priority of promoting climate-resilient activities for the blue economy 2.0, a scheme for restoration and adaptation measures, and coastal aquaculture.The budget also focuses on the Aspirational districts program where assistance will be given to the states for faster development of aspirational districts and blocks, including the generation of ample economic opportunities. This is again very crucial as it has a huge potential to transform the landscape of our country while making sure no -one is left behind.Overall, this budget has embraced economic strategies and develops the building blocks that nurture and uphold growth, promote inclusive and sustainable development, and enhance productivity.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s sixth Budget promises to be responsible despite this being an election year.

The court sought Asokan's response on an application filed by Patanjali Ayurved and posted the matter for further hearing on May 14.On April 29, Asokan had said that it was ""unfortunate"" that SC criticised the association and also some of the practices of private doctors.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Patanjali, told the bench that they had filed an application urging the court to take judicial notice of ""wanton and unwarranted comments"" made by IMA chief.""This is a serious issue. They are trying to divert the course of justice... You asked one or two queries and see how they are reacting as if nobody can ask anything,"" Rohatgi said.

1984 anti-Sikh riots

Constitution controversy

NEW DELHI: Sam Pitroda , the Indian Overseas Congress chairman, has once again found himself embroiled in controversy . Just as the Congress party was attempting to quell the uproar caused by his previous comments on "" inheritance tax ,"" Pitroda has sparked a new firestorm with his latest remarks on India's diversity .While discussing the country's diverse population, Pitroda stated that ""people in the South look like Africans, and those in the East look like Chinese, and those in the East look like Arabs."" His comments have drawn sharp criticism and added to the list of controversial statements he has made in the past.Pitroda, known for his outspoken nature, has a history of stirring up controversy with his public remarks. This latest incident is just one of many instances where his words have caused a stir and put the Congress party in a difficult position.Here are times when he stirred up controversy in the past:: In the midst of eagerly awaiting the inauguration of the Ram Mandir in June 2023, Sam Pitroda ignited a contentious debate with his statement. He claimed that the construction of temples would not provide solutions to the critical challenges faced by India, specifically highlighting the urgent matters of joblessness, rising prices, educational concerns, and healthcare issues.: Sam Pitroda sparked a debate when he discussed the concept of inheritance tax in the United States. He mentioned that these are topics that require further discussion and consideration. Pitroda explained, ""In America, there is an inheritance tax. If one has 100 million USD worth of wealth and when he dies he can only transfer 45 per cent to his children, 55 per cent is grabbed by the government. That's an interesting law. It says you in your generation, made wealth and you are leaving now, you must leave your wealth for the public, not all of it, half of it, which to me sounds fair."" His comments stirred up controversy as he only gave the example of the United States.: In the wake of the Pulwama attack in February 2019, Sam Pitroda sparked a heated discussion by casting doubt on the effectiveness of the Indian Air Force's retaliatory airstrikes on Balakot. His comments, which questioned India's military response, ignited a fierce debate about the country's strategy for dealing with terrorist incidents.“I don’t know much about attacks. It happens all the time. Attack happened in Mumbai, also. We could have then reacted and just sent our planes, but that is not the right approach. According to me, that’s not how you deal with the world,"" Pitroda said.: In response to a question about former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's alleged role in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, Sam Pitroda, a prominent figure in Indian politics , sparked controversy in May 2019 with his dismissive remark, ""so what."" His statement quickly ignited a firestorm of outrage. Pitroda said: ""Ab kya hai '84 ka? Aapne kya kiya 5 saal mein, uski baat kariye.'84 mein hua to hua. You were voted to create jobs. You were voted to create 200 smart cities. Aapne wo bhi nahi kiya. Aapne kuch nahi kiya isliye aap yahan wahan gup lagate hain."" (What about 1984 (riots) now? Talk about what you have done in the last 5 years. What happened in '84 happened. You were voted to create jobs. You were voted to create 200 smart cities. You haven't done that either. You haven't done anything, that's why you are talking nonsense here and there.): In early 2024, the BJP accused the Congress party of being 'anti-Dalit' following remarks made by Sam Pitroda, a senior Congress leader. Pitroda had shared an article written by Sudheendra Kulkarni, who was previously a close associate of LK Advani, a prominent BJP leader. The article claimed that Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, had a greater role in the drafting of the Indian Constitution compared to BR Ambedkar. Pitroda's endorsement of this view led to the BJP's criticism of the Congress party, labeling it as being against the interests of the Dalit community.","Pitroda, known for his outspoken nature, has a history of stirring up controversy with his public remarks.

US West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 65 cents, or 0.83%, to $79.03 a barrel.US crude inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels to 459.5 million barrels in the week ending May 3, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), rising slightly more than analysts' expectations.""Stronger refining activity and exports have encouraged a minor draw to crude inventories, helping unwind some of last week's large build,"" said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler.The EIA, however, expects slower global oil demand growth for the year, a forecast report showed.A strengthening US dollar limited crude oil prices. A stronger greenback dampens oil demand by making it more expensive for investors holding other currencies.Hopes of a ceasefire in Gaza have also put some downward pressure on oil prices in recent trading sessions, with some analysts saying the risk premium on oil had declined in tandem.""Taking away the current geopolitical trigger leaves the market staring into a world of sticky inflation in the US that is countered by interest rates that not only keep the US dollar elevated but make any sort of commodity trading more expensive,"" PVM Oil analyst John Evans said.The US believes negotiations on a Gaza ceasefire should be able to close the gaps between Israel and Hamas. US Central Intelligence Agency Director Bill Burns will travel to Israel on Wednesday for talks with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Morgan Stanley analysts said they see the geopolitical risk for oil prices dissipating as fears of further escalation in the conflict subside.Cautious expectations on supply cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) ahead of a June 1 policy meeting also weighed on markets.Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Tuesday that there had been no discussions about an oil output increase by OPEC+.This came after an earlier statement in the day in which he said the group had the option of increasing production.

Italian power groups clash with government on solar panel curbs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/italian-power-groups-clash-with-government-on-solar-panel-curbs/articleshow/109949316.cms,"MILAN: Italian power groups are at loggerheads with the government over new limits on the installation of solar panels, which they say would put Rome's decarbonisation goals at risk and increase electricity costs .The country's rightwing coalition on Monday approved a ban on photovoltaic systems with modules placed on the ground in areas classified as agricultural land.Elettricita Futura - the lobby representing the country's main power groups including state-controlled utility Enel , A2A and Edison - said the limit would increase costs to develop new solar projects, complicate the permit process and jeopardise Italy's green goals.""The new regulation could also lead to a credibility problem for our country in dealing with companies which have planned projects worth up to 300 billion euros ($323 billion) to make the installations necessary to reach the 2030 targets,"" the lobby said in a statement released late on Tuesday.In its draft plan for energy and climate (PNIEC) the government has pledged to increase energy produced by solar farms by 50 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 as part of its switch out of fossil fuels.Elettricita Futura said this new rule would exacerbate the lack of large solar farms, an issue that keeps the cost of renewable energy high in Italy.""Electricity generated by utility-scale photovoltaic systems costs a third of the electricity generated by residential rooftop photovoltaic systems,"" it said.Agricultural lobbies -- key supporters of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni 's government -- have long called for limitations to the panels, saying they were incompatible with cultivation. ""Agriculture and photovoltaic can coexist,"" said Italia Solare, the Italian association for the solar sector, adding 1% of unoccupied agricultural land would suffice to realise half of the 50 GW required for Italy to meet 2030 targets, with the rest coming from rooftops.

The majority of the world’s economy has faced a global crisis in recent years, with inflation rates skyrocketing in most parts of the world. Many major currencies across the world have suffered due to this, with growth rates slowing at an alarming pace. On the other hand, the cryptocurrency industry has stayed resilient.Currently valued above $2.5T, the cryptocurrency market is currently on the increase, with new tokens flooding the market regularly.Bitcoin (BTC), at the forefront, boasts a market cap of over $1.2T. But what does this mean for the altcoin market ?The altcoin market has continued to grow with the increasing number of new tokens flooding it. Riding on this expansion, tokens like Avalanche (AVAX), Toncoin (TON), Injective (INJ), and Maker (MKR) have seen significant surges in value. Moreso, the latest market entrant, KangaMoon (KANG), has surpassed expectations, already rewarding early buyers in just its fifth presale stage.Since the commencement of its presale campaign, KangaMoon (KANG) has continued to stay strong among other meme tokens. Notably, KangaMoon’s immersive game called ‘Kangaverse’ seamlessly integrates elements of GameFi's play-to-earn model and SocialFi, offering not only premium entertainment but also financial incentives for active participation.By participating in battle-themed contests and periodic challenges, users can earn different rewards, usually in the form of KANG tokens or other valuable in-game items, all of which can be traded in a dedicated marketplace. In addition, KangaMoon has delivered its early buyers with profits following the surge in the value of its native KANG token.With the KANG price increasing from an initial price of $0.005 to $0.0196 in the fifth presale stage, early buyers have now locked in up to 290% in profit. Meanwhile, KangaMoon employs a community-driven approach and already boasts a growing community of over 20,000 registered users, including 6,000 plus token holders.In an attempt to scale further, KangaMoon recently partnered with RaidSharkBot, an engagement bot that would accelerate engagement and participation levels across the altcoin market. This comes amidst KangaMoon’s endeavour to hit the $7M funding milestone, barely after reaching $6M. While KangaMoon continued its impressive ascent, analysts are touting it to be one of the top altcoins to buy.Following a 200% increase in the last year, Injective (INJ) has witnessed a rise in its trading volume, with cryptocurrency traders and enthusiasts flocking to the token’s network. Although the token's previous price action has given way to optimism amongst market analysts, with many projecting a rise for the altcoin. Although it declined by about 35% in the last month and by about 15% in the last week, the token’s previous price action has given way to optimism amongst market analysts, with many projecting a rise for the altcoin.Furthermore, with the rate of adoption and increasing buyer interest surrounding Injective, analysts have touted it to soar to become one of the top altcoins to buy. Currently trading at a weekly price range between $28.0 and $29.2, Injective also boasts a market cap of about $2.2B, a testament to its expanding ecosystem.Toncoin (TON) has soared in the last year, with an increase of about 137%. Since then, the token has seen an influx of traders and crypto enthusiasts, with many vying for a place on its network. Despite declining in the past week and month by 8% and 1%, respectively, Toncoin has seen an impressive increase in its trading volume, indicating a mass adoption and purchase of the TON token.Emerging as a decentralised network, Toncoin aims to revolutionise communication amongst people on the internet. With blockchain technology and unique peer-to-peer protocols, Toncoin creates a reliable and secure platform for communication, including calls and video sharing. Currently trading within a weekly price range of $5.66 and $5.95, Toncoin’s developing ecosystem possesses the potential to become one of the top cryptocurrencies in the altcoin market.One of the most popular and largest cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap, Avalanche has been making rounds in the cryptocurrency market after its meteoric rise in the last year. Surging by about 87%, Avalanche (AVAX) has continued to stir the attention of crypto traders and enthusiasts around the cryptocurrency market.However, like most tokens, Avalanche has succumbed to the state of the bearish market with a decline of about 39% in the last month and nearly $16% in the last seven days. While these are trying times for the AVAX token, market observers are optimistic, projecting the token to mirror its former price surges as the altcoin market grows. With a market cap of about $12.3B and a rapidly rising trading volume, Avalanche has displayed its potential to rise in the coming months.Riding on a 280% high in the last year, Maker (MKR) has solidified itself as a mainstay cryptocurrency in the altcoin market. However, due to the unpredictability and volatility of the crypto market, Maker has plunged 27% in the last month and about 6% in the last seven days.While this highlights the MKR token's bearish tendencies, it also suggests an upcoming surge for the cryptocurrency. Currently trading at a weekly price range between $2,862 and $3,140, this token is one to watch out for in the coming months.Discover the exciting opportunities of the KangaMoon (KANG) presale today!Website: https://kangamoon.com/ Join the Telegram community: https://t.me/kangamoonofficial","KangaMoon (KANG) has surpassed expectations, already rewarding early buyers in just its fifth presale stage.

Russia considers lifting gasoline exports ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/russia-considers-lifting-gasoline-exports-ban/articleshow/109923405.cms,"MOSCOW: Russia is considering lifting its gasoline exports ban, officials and sources said on Tuesday, as oil refineries return from maintenance and fuel stockpiles rise.Russia imposed a partial gasoline exports ban for six months from March 1 in order to pre-empt fuel shortages and stem a rise in prices following a spate of Ukrainian drone attacks on refineries and technical outages.Fuel exports have continued to a Moscow-led economic union and to some countries with which Russia has direct inter-government agreements on fuel supplies, such as Mongolia.Russia in 2023 produced 43.9 million tons of gasoline and exported about 5.76 million tons, or about 13% of production. The biggest importers of Russian gasoline are mainly African countries, including Nigeria, Libya and Tunisia, and also the United Arab Emirates.""The energy ministry is now proposing to consider the issue of allowing the export of gasoline for a certain period,"" acting Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told Interfax news agency.He also said the issue would be considered by the government soon.Novak is not in a permanent role as the new government has not been formally announced following the inauguration of Vladimir Putin for his sixth term as Russian President .""So far, the measures that were taken on March 1 to ban the exports have worked in full.

'Financial guru forecasts massive stock market correction in US',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/financial-guru-forecasts-massive-stock-market-correction-in-us/articleshow/109919191.cms,"NEW DELHI: Grant Cardone , a seasoned private equity fund manager, has issued a stark warning about an imminent stock market crash that could see values halve, potentially wiping out the retirement and savings of millions of Americans. The Dow Jones' recent gains notwithstanding, Cardone highlighted the alarming trend in the S&P's yield curve, which has been inverted for over 500 days—a historical precursor to significant market downturns including those in 1929, 1974, and 2009.In a recent statement on the social media platform X, Cardone outlined the dire consequences of such a crash, compounded by current inflation rates, which could effectively amplify total losses to feel more like 75%.""WARNING: Stock Market is due for 50 percent correction taking S&P below 2674,"" he cautioned, emphasizing the risk to retirement accounts heavily invested in the stock market at these levels, a Daily Mail report said.Cardone, who has advised companies such as Google and Morgan Stanley, drew parallels between the current market indicators and those that preceded major financial crises in the past. He explained that following the historical crashes, the market declines erased significant value from Americans' 401Ks, affecting their long-term savings and financial security.The financial expert also criticized the Federal Reserve's recent rate hikes, arguing that they have stifled the housing market rather than controlling inflation as intended. ""Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has not controlled inflation. He has failed miserably,"" Cardone said. He suggests that reducing interest rates might rejuvenate the housing market, encouraging more sales and potentially lowering house prices.To safeguard against potential financial turmoil, Cardone recommends transitioning retirement funds from stock market-dependent 401ks to real assets that generate consistent cash flow, such as property investments. He believes this strategy could provide retirees with a more stable and reliable income source.This warning comes as Manhattan sees a drop in rents for the first time since the pandemic, signaling potential shifts in the real estate market that could offer investment opportunities amid economic uncertainties.","Grant Cardone, a seasoned private equity fund manager, has issued a stark warning about an imminent stock market crash that could see values halve.

"SIA Group orders SAF, offers flyers option to cut their CO2 footprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/sia-group-orders-saf-offers-flyers-option-to-cut-their-co2-footprint/articleshow/109917309.cms,"MUMBAI: Singapore Airlines and Scoot of Singapore Airlines ( SIA ) Group have become the first airlines operating out of Singapore-Changi airport to receive Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) produced in Neste ’s refinery in Singapore. Both the airlines will offer corporate flyers, shippers, cargo companies the option to buy offsets to claim environmental benefits.Starting from May 2024, the SIA Group airlines will offer 1,000 SAF `Book & Claim Units’ (BCUs) for purchase by its corporate travellers, shippers, and freight forwarders, the airline said. “Each BCU represents one tonne of neat SAF with its associated carbon dioxide reduction benefit. Purchasing SAF BCUs allows corporate travellers, shippers, and freight forwarders to claim the associated environmental benefits for flights related to their business travel and operations, validating the demand for SAF BCUs and supporting the development of the nascent SAF industry,” it added. The Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) Book & Claim system, a trusted industry standard, ensures the traceability and credibility of these transactions, it said. “RSB is a global membership organisation that drives the sustainable transition to a bio-based and circular economy. The Book & Claim system enables the decoupling of sustainability attributes from certified SAF. The decoupled sustainability attributes can be used to generate SAF Book & Claim Units (BCUs), which can be transferred to another account holder and retired in a robust and transparent manner,” said SIA.The SIA Group agreement with Neste involves the purchase of 1,000 tonnes of SAF, produced at Neste’s refinery at Singapore Changi Airport . Neste will blend the SAF with conventional jet fuel and deliver the blended jet fuel directly to Changi Airport’s fuel hydrant system in two batches – once in the second quarter of 2024 and once in the fourth quarter of this year, SIA said in a press statement. The said SAF blended fuel will meet the safety specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), an international standard for conventional jet fuel quality, it added. Blended with conventional jet fuel, it seamlessly integrates with existing aircraft engines and fuelling infrastructure, it added.“This milestone will also mark the first direct supply of Neste’s SAF to airlines at Changi Airport, reinforcing their end-to-end SAF supply chain capabilities in Singapore. This follows the completion of the expansion of Neste’s Singapore refinery in May 2023. The refinery has the capacity to produce a million tonnes of SAF each year, making it the world’s largest SAF production facility,” it said.“Neste’s SAF, which is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over the fuel’s life cycle,” said SIA. The 80% reductionof lifecycle carbon emissions is when SAF is used in neat (unblended) form and when the emissions are calculated with established life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies, such as the CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) methodology. The said calculation includes both production and transport emissions.Alexander Kueper, Vice President Renewable Aviation, Neste, said: “We are proud that Singapore Airlines and Scoot are our first customers benefiting from our integrated supply capabilities into Changi Airport. This supply of locally produced SAF to Changi Airport is a milestone in our journey of supporting the aviation industry and governments in the region to achieve their emissions reduction goals. Singapore is a leading aviation hub in the Asia-Pacific region and this delivery of SAF, as well as the recently announced national SAF target, will hopefully encourage the wider adoption of SAF across the broader Asia-Pacific region. We are looking forward to expanding our cooperation with Singapore Airlines as well as supplying visiting carriers at Changi Airport.”Lee Wen Fen, Chief Sustainability Officer, Singapore Airlines, said: “This agreement with Neste is an important milestone in the SIA Group’s journey to have a minimum of 5% sustainable aviation fuel in our total fuel uplift by 2030. Close collaboration with our partners and stakeholders, both in Singapore and globally, plays a critical role in our long-term decarbonisation goals. A more sustainable aviation industry will ensure that future generations continue to benefit from the global connectivity, economic prosperity, and people links that air travel fosters.”","Singapore Airlines and Scoot of Singapore Airlines ( SIA ) Group have become the first airlines operating out of Singapore-Changi airport to receive Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) The SIA Group agreement with Neste involves the purchase of 1,000 tonnes of SAF.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109919380,imgsize-873301,width-400,resizemode-4/109919380.jpg"
