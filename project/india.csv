Sucharita Mohanty) as the party candidate for the ensuing general elections to the Lok Sabha from 17 - Puri Parliamentary Constituency of Odisha,"" the Congress said in a statement.Patnaik has been associated with the Congress for the past few years, he will make his electoral debut in this election.The last date for filing nominations in Puri is May 6.Mohanty, who stood second from Puri in the 2014 polls, returned her ticket on Saturday, saying that without the party's financial help, it will not be possible for her to campaign in Puri.In a letter to party general secretary KC Venugopal, Mohanty claimed that her campaign in the Puri constituency ""has been hit hard"" due to lack of funds adding that her efforts to raise funds through public donation drive also saw little to no success.""Our campaign in the Puri Parliamentary constituency has been hit hard because the party has denied me funding. AICC Odisha in-charge Ajoy Kumar ji categorically asked me to fund for myself. I was a salaried professional journalist who entered electoral politics 10 years ago. I have given all I have into my campaign in Puri,"" Mohanty stated in her letter.""I tried a public donation drive to support my campaign for progressive politics without much success so far. I also tried to cut down the projected campaign spending to the minimum,"" she added.She further said that the party's central leadership did not tend to her several requests to provide funds.""Since I couldn't raise funds on my own, I knocked at your and all other doors of our party's central leadership urging them to commit the necessary party funds for an impactful campaign in Puri Parliament seat. Like in 2014, I found a groundswell of popular support behind our party and my candidature. In this 2024 Satta Vs Janata election, the people are all set to throw out the two corrupt and scamsters ruling parties, BJP and BJP and vote for 5 Nyays and 25 guarantees of Congress,"" Mohanty said.Puri is among the high-profile poll battles that will unfold in Odisha, with the BJP fielding its national spokesperson Sambit Patra for the second straight time and Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik's BJD fielding former Mumbai Police commissioner Arup Patnaik. The constituency, currently held by the Biju Janata Dal's (BJD) Pinaki Misra, votes in the sixth phase on May 25.In 2019, the Congress secured only 3.94 per cent of the votes in Puri.

Actor lost money to cyber fraudster for the second time in less than four months,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/actor-lost-money-to-cyber-fraudster-for-the-second-time-in-less-than-four-months/articleshow/109850129.cms,"MUMBAI: A fraudster fraudulently transferred a total of Rs4.98 lakhs from the nationalised bank account that is jointly owned by Bollywood and television actor Rakesh Bedi (69) and his wife Aradhana (59) on Friday. The Oshiwara police , who registered the case, stated that it was a single transaction carried out to siphon the money.The fraudster successfully transferred the funds without requiring a one-time password ( OTP ) or any link shared with Bedi's wife.""We have got in touch with the bank's nodal officer to block the account to which the money was credited after siphoned from Bedi's account. The cyber wing of the police station is attempting to trace the money trails to all the banks where it has been credited,” said a police officer from the Oshiwara police station.The officer mentioned that this is a distinctive method of operation where the fraudster did not acquire any data through links, remote access, or OTP to commit the fraud. Bedi's spouse, Aradhana, did not answer the call from TOI, while the actor mentioned that he would respond later.In the complaint, Bedi's wife said: ""I was at my Andheri (West) home when I received at least five calls from an unknown number at 7.15 pm on Friday. But, I did not respond to the calls. Finally, I attended the sixth call and the caller informed that his account has been wrongly credited with Rs4,98,694.50 that was debited from account. The person informed that an OTP has been sent to my mobile and asked to share the same. I immediately disconnected the call suspecting something amiss.""An officer from Oshiwara police mentioned that the wife of the actor examined her text messages on the mobile and observed an OTP notification. ""She immediately logged into netbanking and noticed Rs4.98 lakhs has been debited from the joint account despite not sharing any details. The situation is unique because the fraudster managed to transfer the funds without the actor's wife sharing any confidential banking information or OTP,” said the officer.In December 2023, Bedi was deceived of Rs85,000 by an individual who falsely claimed to be a member of the army and expressed interest in purchasing his Pune flat valued at Rs87 lakhs. The individual requested Bedi to transfer the funds under the pretense of transferring double the amount, citing restrictions on direct fund transfers from an Army account. The Oshiwara police filed a case on December 30 after Bedi discovered that he had been deceived.",A fraudster fraudulently transferred a total of Rs4.98 lakhs from the nationalised bank account that is jointly owned by Bollywood and television actor Rakesh Bedi (69) and his wife Aradhana (59) The fraudster successfully transferred the funds without requiring a one-time password ( OTP ) or any link shared with Bedi's wife.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109850152,imgsize-14298,width-400,resizemode-4/109850152.jpg"

New Delhi: Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud on Saturday expressed concern over growing footprint of juveniles in cybercrime and suggested that countries and their agencies should cooperate to deal with the problem.Speaking at a National Symposium on Juvenile Justice organised in Nepal, Justice Chandrachud said that specific training programmes should be evolved by incorporating principles of trauma-informed care and by emphasising sensitivity and empathy towards juvenile offenders who may have experienced adverse experiences in life.“The changing nature of crimes, particularly with the increasing prevalence of digital crime, poses new challenges for juvenile justice systems globally. Recent data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in India, unveiled last month, paints a concerning picture regarding cybercrimes.

"One soldier killed, four injured in terror attack on IAF convoy in J&K's Poonch",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-iaf-personnel-injured-after-terrorists-open-fire-on-two-security-vehicles-in-jks-poonch/articleshow/109843365.cms,"NEW DELHI: One of five soldiers injured in terrorist attack on Indian Air Force (IAF) convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch district died on Saturday.""In the ensuing gunfight with terrorists , the Air Warriors fought back by returning fire. In the process, five IAF personnel received bullet injuries and were evacuated to the nearest military hospital for immediate medical attention.One Air Warrior succumbed to his injuries later. Further operations are on by the local security forces,"" the Indian Air Force said in a statement.The incident occurred near Shashidhar as the vehicles were en route to Sanai Top in the Surankote area of the district. The terrorists opened fire at two security vehicles, one of which belonged to the IAF.""An Indian Air Force vehicle convoy was attacked by militants in the Poonch district of J&K, near Shahsitar. Cordon and search operations are underway presently in the area by local military units. The convoy has been secured, and further investigation is under progress,"" the IAF said in a post on X.""Five soldiers were injured. The injured troops have been airlifted to Command Hospital, Udhampur for further treatment,"" the officials said.This comes three weeks ahead of polling in Anantnag-Rajouri Lok Sabha constituency. Poonch is part of Anantnag-Rajouri parliamentary constituency which is going to polls in the sixth phase on May 25.The vehicles were moving towards nearby Sanai Top in the district's Surankote area, they said, suspecting the involvement of the same group of terrorists who carried out an ambush on the troops in adjoining Bufliaz on December 21 last year, that left four soldiers dead and three others injured.The Army truck bore the major brunt of the firing by the terrorists who were armed with AK assault rifles and are believed to have fled into the nearby forests, the officials said.Additional forces from the army and police have been deployed to the region and cordon operation has been launched to track down and neutralise the terrorists.A comprehensive search and cordon operation is currently underway to locate and neutralize the terrorists responsible for the attack, as per the officials.Police assisted by paramilitary forces carried out searches in Poonch town since Friday following inputs about movement of suspected persons. However, no one was arrested during the operation, the officials said.The latest incident in the Pir Panjal region followed the killing of a government employee Mohd Razaq, brother of an Army personnel, by terrorists at village Kunda Top in Rajouri's Shahdra area on April 22 and a village defence guard Mohd Sharief in Basantgarh area of Udhampur on April 28.Police have released pictures of two Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists, including suspected Pakistani national Abu Hamza, involved in the murder of Razaq and announced a cash reward of Rs 10 lakh on his head.The Bufliaz ambush in December last year came weeks after a major gunfight in the Dharmsal belt of Bajimaal forest in Rajouri that left five Army personnel, including two captains, dead a month earlier.Two terrorists, including a top commander of LeT identified as Quari, were also killed in the two-day long gunfight. Quari was said to be the mastermind behind several attacks, including the killing of 10 civilians and five Army personnel in the district.The stretch between Dhera Ki Gali and Bufliaz on the boundary of Rajouri and Poonch is densely forested and leads to Chamrer forest and then Bhata Dhurian forest, where five soldiers were killed in an ambush on an Army vehicle on April 20 last year.In May last year, five more Army personnel were killed and a major-rank officer was injured in Chamrer forest during an anti-terrorist operation. A foreign terrorist was also killed in the operation.In 2022, five Army personnel were killed when terrorists carried out a suicide attack on their camp at Pargal in Darhal area of Rajouri district. Both the terrorists involved in the attack were eliminated.In 2021, nine soldiers were killed in two separate attacks by terrorists in the forested region. While five Army personnel, including a junior commissioned officer (JCO), were killed on October 11 in Chamrer, a JCO and three soldiers were killed on October 14 in a nearby forest.(With inputs from PTI)",One of five soldiers injured in terrorist attack on Indian Air Force (IAF) convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch district died on Saturday.

Now, from what we can see there are reports that some people who have a background in terrorism, some of them died in pretty unusual circumstances. That is something they need to investigate,” he said in Bhubaneswar.The Union minister emphasized that Pakistan should first address the question of why there are so many terrorists within their borders and why the country is so protective of them.“First, they need to answer why there are so many terrorists in Pakistan. Terrorists are not very nice people. They could be doing things to each other. I am not entirely aware of the Khan article. But I do know rather than saying why these people are dying, I would first ask why there are so many terrorists in Pakistan. And why is Pakistan so protective of them. that is the question, which should be answered,” the external affairs minister said.","S Jaishankar dismissed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan ’s accusation of India carrying out killings in their country.

55% Covidshield recipients had mild side effects: AMCH study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/55-covidshield-recipients-had-mild-side-effects-amch-study/articleshow/109845602.cms,"GUWAHATI: A study conducted by physician-scientists from Assam Medical College Hospital (Dibrugarh), supported by ICMR-recognised multidisciplinary research laboratory, has revealed that 55% of Covishield vaccine recipients experienced only minor side effects like fever and headache. These symptoms occurred within a week of getting inoculated with the first dose.Researchers confirmed no long-term adverse effects after a year.“In our study, we found that 55% experienced minor adverse events such as fever, headache, body ache and pain at the injection site. The remaining 45% of the recipients had no adverse events at all. After the second dose, only 6.8% showed minor adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). Most importantly, no participant showed any major adverse events during the entire one year period of study,” said associate professor of pathology at AMCH, Gayatri Gogoi, the principal investigator of the study done in Assam’s Dibrugarh district.The major (serious and severe) adverse events were defined as disabling, rare life-threatening conditions that may lead to long-term problems. “The young individuals had more minor adverse events than the elderly individuals. What is also intriguing to note is that those who had comorbidities or other health conditions showed less adverse events,” she added.The study was conducted from July 2021 when the first Covishield vaccine for the public was introduced and participants were followed up till June 2022 after receiving the approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee to conduct the same. This data of research findings was recently accepted for publication in a well-known PubMed indexed journal named Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care.The doctor-research investigators felt the need of sharing the real-time research data from Dibrugarh district, led by Gayatri Gogoi, who is also a renowned cancer researcher, along with Dr Gourangie Gogoi, professor of community medicine at AMCH, Dr Bhupendra Narayan Mahanta, professor of medicine (currently posted at Lakhimpur Medical College Hospital) and Dr Mithu Medhi, professor of microbiology (currently posted at Kokrajhar Medical College Hospital) after completing a study on Covishield vaccine effectiveness and AEFI or side effects. The study design was done in consultation with Dr Biswajyoti Borkakoty, head of Regional Viral Research & Diagnostic Laboratory, Regional Medical Research Centre-NE Region (ICMR), Dibrugarh as nodal officer from this region for the pandemic time.The researchers said during the peak of the Delta variant wave in June 2021, it was found that 61% of the participants had been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The remaining 39% were sero-negative, meaning they had not contracted the virus and had received the Covishield vaccine.Regarding the effectiveness or antibody development, 93% remained positive and the antibody level was much higher in case of the vaccinated. Among those participants previously infected by SARS-CoV-2 virus, the first dose of Covishield vaccine acted as booster dose and was enough to enhance high rise of antibody titre in contrast to SARS-CoV-2 uninfected participants. “The final inference was that natural virus infections confer stronger immune responses than Covishield vaccine alone,” said Gogoi.","55% of Covishield vaccine recipients experienced only minor side effects like fever and headache. After the second dose, only 6.8% showed minor adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) No participant showed any major adverse events during the entire one year period of study.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109845588,imgsize-1947025,width-400,resizemode-4/109845588.jpg"

PM Modi a ‘shahanshah': Priyanka Gandhi responds to ‘shehzada' jibe for Rahul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-a-shahanshaah-priyanka-gandhi-responds-to-shehzada-jibe-for-rahul/articleshow/109844698.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, labeling him 'Shahanshah' (king of kings) during a public rally held in Lakhani, Gujarat's Banaskantha Lok Sabha constituency. Her remarks came in response to PM Modi 's recent jibe at her brother Rahul Gandhi, where he referred to him as ' shehzada ' (prince).Addressing a public rally at Lakhani in Gujarat's Banaskantha Lok Sabha constituency to canvass for her party candidate Geniben Thakor, she also accused PM Modi of using the people of Gujarat for power and then forgetting them.“He calls my brother ‘shehzada'. I would like to tell him that this shehzada walked for 4,000 kilometres from Kanyakumari to Kashmir to listen to your (people's) problems, met my brothers and sisters, farmers and labourers and asked how we can resolve their problems,” she said.Addressing a rally in Gujarat on Thursday, PM Modi had targeted Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, saying Pakistan was eager to make the ‘shehzada' of the grand old party India's next PM as the country's enemies want a weak government at the helm.“On the other hand is your ‘shahanshah', Narendra Modiji. He lives in a palace. Have you ever seen him on TV? Clean clothes with not a single speck of dust, not a single stray hair strand. How will he ever understand your hard work, your farming? How will he understand your problems, that you are overburdened with inflation?” she said.In her speech, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also criticized PM Modi's governance, alleging that his policies have weakened the rights of the public, citing attempts to amend the Constitution and privatize government sectors.“When they say they want to change the Constitution, it means they want to reduce and weaken all the rights given to you in the Constitution. If you understand politics today, the biggest thing that Modi has done in the last 10 years is to weaken the rights of the public,” she said.She questioned PM Modi's decision to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi instead of Gujarat, attributing it to his detachment from the people of Gujarat, whom she claimed he had utilized for gaining power but subsequently forgotten.“Modi is surrounded by power and no longer recognises you. Why is he not contesting elections from here if he is not cut off from the people of Gujarat,” she asked.She said Modi was contesting from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and not Gujarat because he is cut off from the people of Gujarat.“He used you, earned power, name and respect with your support and went on to become the prime minister only to forget you and cut himself off from you,” she said.Gandhi also attacked Modi over his statement that Pakistan wanted to make Rahul Gandhi the next PM of India and use X-ray machines to steal ‘mangalsutra' and gold belonging to the public when voted to power.“The is in India, and Pakistan is being talked about...Such low-level utterances by the country's prime minister? You elected a prime minister to keep the country's respect intact, one whom the entire country could see talking sense, because this has been our tradition,"" she said.She alleged that the PM speaks a lot of lies.“Earlier it was limited to lies, now he utters such gibberish that Congress will steal one of your two buffaloes. Congress had been in power for 55 years, did it ever steal your buffalo and jewellery using an X-ray machine,” she asked.The PM is making such statements because the public is waking up and asking him not to make Hindu-Muslim the issue in an election and instead talk about electricity, water, jobs and inflation, she said.She said that the then Congress government formed cooperative sectors like Amul and Banas Dairy for the prosperity of farmers and claimed that today BJP leaders are trying to capture the sector.Equality is enshrined in the Constitution. “Today the prime minister himself says that those fighting for equality are anti-Constitution. You must understand how you are being misled,” she said.Gandhi also targeted Modi over unemployment and said that over 30 lakh central government posts are vacant.She claimed that the unemployment rate is the highest in 45 years and accused Modi of giving away government properties to billionaires which she claimed has reduced jobs. Privatisation of government jobs has ended reservations, she said.“Youth are jobless but the government is not filling these posts. You are focused elsewhere and not on job creation. When you don't get a job, you work for outsourcing and contract employment,” she said.“All the (country's) properties now belong to the billionaires. If the government understood (this) properly, they'd know that they need to create jobs...But he does not think about you...All policies are meant for billionaires,"" she said.She said Modi's biggest policy is to make everything ""for the success and prosperity of billionaires”.Gandhi said the now-scrapped Electoral Bonds were “a scheme for corruption”.“The government came out with a scheme for corruption. At one time, corruption was committed with stealth. Now it is being committed through a scheme. And you still have the gall to say you are honest and all other leaders are corrupt,” she said.She said the BJP became the world's richest political party by taking away the properties belonging to the public.In Banaskantha, which will go to polls in the third phase on May 7, the BJP has nominated Rekha Chaudhary, an engineering college professor and first-timer, against Congress' Thakor.(With inputs from agencies)","Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

NEW DELHI: Congress general secretary (communications) Jairam Ramesh on Friday said the party’s position on Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) was clearly stated in its manifesto where it promised to “review and change all anti-people laws” brought by BJP govt. However, he refused to explicitly say whether the contentious law would be repealed.Senior Congress politician P Chidambaram had said last month that CAA would be scrapped once the INDIA bloc was voted to office.Notably, CAA did not find a mention in the party’s manifesto, which was drafted under Chidambaram’s chairmanship.Asked whether the party would repeal CAA, Ramesh told, “I am not commenting on what Chidambaram said. What he said is his personal view. I am going by the manifesto approved by him as chairman of the committee and approved by Congress prez and the party’s working committee. I am stating the party position. The word CAA does not figure in the manifesto.” He, however, said Congress believed that making religion the basis of reservation and citizenship was unconstitutional.“We opposed CAA in Parliament on the ground that it gives citizenship on the basis of religion. Our Constitution doesn’t provide for reservation or citizenship on the basis of religion,” Ramesh added.Congress manifesto said, “We promise that all anti-people laws passed by the BJP-NDA without proper parliamentary scrutiny and debate, especially those relating to workers, farmers, criminal justice, environment and forests and digital data protection will be thoroughly reviewed and changed.”","Congress general secretary (communications) Jairam Ramesh on Friday said the party’s position on Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) was clearly stated in its manifesto.

QUOTA DILEMMA

BEGGING BANS

CONCERNS ABOUT VIOLENCE

W hen Shreegauri Sawant petitioned the Supreme Court to recognise the rights of transgender people a decade ago, she did not have much hope. To her surprise, the Nalsa (National Legal Services Authority) judgment became the bedrock of her community’s civil liberties in India — recognising the sex-gender distinction, creating a legal third gender category and issuing directives to state and central governments to ensure fundamental rights for trans people.Today, she, yet again, is not feeling much hope. “The visibility that trans people have is because of us, not the government. Class is such a big factor — people with coloured hair in big companies may be better off, but the trans people who were at red lights ten years ago are still at red lights,” says the activist who runs the NGO Sakhi Char Chowghi Trust .The landmark Nalsa judgment, which came on April 15, 2014, defined gender as ‘the innate perception of one’s gender,’ opening doors for self-determination. Lawyer Tripti Tandon, deputy director of the Delhi-based Lawyers Collective, says, “As someone who was part of the legal process in Nalsa, it was a monumental win. Before, there was some sporadic litigation, but transgender people were non-existent legally. Courts were not even an avenue they could access.” She remembers a client who would always carry a print-out of the judgment to remind people of where the Supreme Court stood. Another’s family accepted their identity after the judgment.Its directives to state and central government fell largely under three buckets — one, self-determination of one’s identity. Two, it asked governments to ensure inclusion in social welfare schemes and third, to create a system of reservations for admission in educational institutions and for public appointments.Muskan Tibrewala, assistant director, Law and Marginalisation Clinic at the Centre for Justice, Law and Society, who provides pro-bono legal services to trans people, argues that while the momentous judgment led to normative recognition of the community, efforts over the last 10 years to turn that into substantial impact have been lacking. “There are clampdowns on begging, transgender state boards are not working in many states and only two states have set up transgender protection cells in police stations as directed. An activist in Haryana had to go to court to make that happen,” says Tibrewala. Others agreed that while Nalsa created systems to access social change, trans people are still having to fight each step on the way. As Sawant puts it, “It’s like inviting someone to your house for dinner but saying you can only come if you bring a silver plate and golden spoon.”The judgment, and The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 that stemmed from it, have spoken of self-identification of gender. “That is the part of Nalsa that has got the most implementation. Before this, you would have to get sex reassignment surgery, but now there are two certificates. You can self-identify as trans legally, but if you want to legally identify as a man or woman you need some kind of medical procedure like HRT or a psychiatric evaluation,” says Tibrewala. “The problem is that the process on the ground is badly implemented.”Activist Vyjayanti Vasanta Mogli, who was also a petitioner in last year’s marriage equality case, points out the many hurdles. “Firstly, one has to get a transgender ID card through the National Transgender Portal. But, in Telangana where I work, there is a backlog of almost one and a half years. Collectors and district magistrates are not sensitised, and neither are clinical psychologists and psychiatrists whose evaluation is needed for certificates. They still search for pathological causes of our identity,” says Mogli. Tandon has heard from clients that officials had no idea trans men existed.Reservation is the sphere that has seen least progress, says Tandon. “It’s worked out in states like Karnataka, but it’s been left to states and local activists to see if they can get this demand moving.” Plus, the judgment treats being transgender as a caste identity, so if you’re a transgender person who is Dalit, you have to choose which identity is affording you reservations, Tibrewala points out. The community calls for horizontal and interlocking reservations, which account for the caste heterogeneity of India’s trans people.Recently, Pune police banned begging by the trans community. “It’s easy to say, don’t beg, but are we getting a single penny to survive? Are we getting jobs? No one is begging because they want to,” says Sawant. Kalki Subramaniam, who serves on the National Council for Transgender Persons, adds, “Without opportunities of education, entrepreneurship or instating livelihood initiatives, how can the system boycott trans people from begging? We are excluded from our families, leaving no choice but to beg or do sex work.”Mogli says the 2019 Act is “a joke” when it comes to provisions for atrocities against transgender people. “The legislation was in response to the mandate enshrined in NALSA. However, the sentence is 6 months to two years, and perpetrators can get police station bail — they don’t even have to go to court for that.”","The landmark Nalsa judgment, which came on April 15, 2014, defined gender as ‘the innate perception of one’s gender,’ opening doors for self-determination.

Centre lifts onion export ban as Maha readies for LS polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-lifts-onion-export-ban-as-maha-readies-for-ls-polls/articleshow/109846525.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt on Saturday lifted the ban on onion exports after five months, in a move that is likely to bring huge relief to farmers and traders in Maharashtra ahead of the remaining phases of Lok Sabha polls in this key producing state. But the move comes with conditions. Traders can ship out onion at a minimum export price (MEP) of $550/tonne and pay another 40% export duty on this price, which translates to Rs 64,000 per tonne or Rs 64 per kg.The decision comes just before the next phases of polls, particularly in Maharashtra’s onion belts including Nasik, Ahmednagar and Shirdi. Onion growers in many parts of Maharashtra have been protesting against the export ban alleging it has hit their earnings as mandi prices at Lasalgaon are ruling around Rs 15/kg, which barely covers the cost of production.Market players, however, said lifting the ban may not bring much benefit to traders. “The condition of 40% export duty on MEP will make it difficult to export onions,” said Jaydutt Holkar, director, Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), Lasalgaon.Govt officials said the decision was taken after assessing crop volume, arrival of onions at mandis, prevailing market conditions, and to avoid storage loss. Consumer affairs secretary Nidhi Khare said estimated Rabi crop (2024-25), which has a share of around 60% of total annual onion output, is around 191 lakh tonnes. She said this is “reasonably comfortable” considering that monthly domestic onion consumption is around 17 lakh tonne.“With a good Kharif prospect with ‘above-normal’ monsoon forecast, availability of onion is comfortable till arrivals of Kharif output. Since onion is a perishable crop, it has to be consumed either domestically or through export within 5-6 months of harvesting and holding on to Rabi stock beyond shelf life will only result in more storage loss,” she said. The secretary added that storage loss increases significantly after three months.DGFT director general Santosh Kumar Sarangi said, “effectively” onion shipments are being allowed at a minimum price of $770 per tonne and added that MEP and export duty have been arrived at considering recent price trend of govt-to-govt supply and prevailing international price of kitchen staple.Sources said availability of onion is expected to increase in international markets with removal of export ban by Egypt following a 300% rise in production and Pakistan too removing its export restrictions.","Traders can ship out onion at a minimum export price (MEP) of $550/tonne and pay another 40% export duty on this price, which translates to Rs 64,000 per tonne or Rs 64 per kg.

For example, price difference between ‘comfort plus’ and ‘flex’ fares would typically be about Rs 1,000 on a domestic sector like Delhi-Mumbai, with ‘flex’ fare providing value of nearly Rs 9,000, including 10kg extra baggage, zero change or cancellation fees, more loyalty points, greater choice of free seats to choose from.”Now on domestic routes in economy class, both ‘comfort’ and ‘comfort plus’ fare families offer 15kg baggage allowance, while ‘flex’ provides 25kg allowance.

""Congress ke shehzade ko Modi ke aansoon acchey lagte hain (the prince of Congress loves to see Modi's tears),"" he said, reciting the popular Hindi couplet ""Jaake paon phate na phate biwai, So kya jaane peer parai"" (only those who have suffered themselves can empathise with the miseries of others), adding that Rahul was born with the proverbial silver spoon.Referring to Rahul's remark that Modi would soon break down on dais, Modi also said that he would remain focused on his tasks of making India a developed nation and was not going to leave the arena until the objective has been accomplished.He also said that Congress was not serious about eradication of poverty and could not move beyond choreographed visits of PMs to the hamlets of poor, but BJP govt has made a determined effort to help bring people out of poverty by providing them with houses and other facilities.""Your one vote fulfilled the aspirations of countless mothers and liberated this land from Naxalite terrorism. During the Congress regime, the situation was dire,"" Modi added.","PM Narendra Modi said that if he turns emotional it is only because he, having been born into poverty, emphathises with the underprivileged and has an insight into what they go through. He also said that Rahul who was born into privilege can never understand this.

"After 40 years in Gandhi family borough, Rajiv's 'high potential boy' is Congress pick",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-40-years-in-gandhi-family-borough-rajivs-high-potential-boy-is-congress-pick/articleshow/109846406.cms,"NEW DELHI: Kishori Lal Sharma is the first of the cadre of youngsters recruited by Rajiv Gandhi who, new to politics in 1983, had the idea of creating a team of young ideologues who would provide feedback on the implementation of govt policies and also specialise in constituency management. They came to be known as the ""high potential boys"", a total of 10 shortlisted out of 135 following an evaluation of their performance in districts where they were posted for some time.AICC general secretary and J&K politician Ghulam Ahmed Mir recalls that Sharma and he, part of the first batch, were very young, and were sent to Amethi to look after the constituency.While Mir went on to become a name in Kashmir politics, Sharma, who hails from Ludhiana, stayed on with Amethi and Rae Bareli , spending four decades in the family borough. ""After the Nehru-Gandhi family, Sharma is the man best known to workers and locals,"" Mir said.No wonder, he was elated at his ""batchmate"" becoming the Congress candidate for the VIP seat. Mir now plans to campaign for his friend in the constituency he once managed for the party and its first family.Four decades of affiliation, from Rajiv Gandhi to Satish Sharma to Sonia Gandhi to Rahul Gandhi, and the resultant trust, is what made the Gandhis pick ""Kishoriji"" above any relative or loyalist as the standard bearer in the place identified with them.A soft-spoken Punjabi known for his man skills, Sharma has managed a low profile while delivering high results. As Sonia and Rahul worked on the national stage during the UPA decade, he was the go-to man who patiently listened to the demanding constituents used to having the personal ear of prime ministers and potential PMs, managing the local office and travelling across the region, with a team of aides. From time to time, he would also bring batches of people for personal audience with the VIPs, working overtime to keep all in good humour. The voters of Amethi-Rae Bareli-Sultanpur were famously known as pampered. In Delhi, he would operate faceless out of a South Avenue bungalow, attending to visitors from the family borough.What set him apart from others was that he stayed on in one place, building a wealth of knowledge about mohallas, villages, castes, and their political leanings. His data bank on demographics and a keen eye on shifting sands of local politics has served the party well, a reason why rivals found it hard to break through the fortress barring the occasional success. As Mir recalls, Sharma has stayed put for four decades, which is impossible for a political worker given personal aspirations.When Rahul came to politics in 2004, he built his team for the constituency, while Sharma looked after Rae Bareli. But he was the overall incharge, keeping an eye on the goings on. He also became an AICC secretary, looking after other states like Bihar.An aide joked that ""Kishoriji"" would find it difficult to fight polls because he would forever be concerned if his campaign team was managing as competently for him, as he has been doing for others. So highly is his work rated.Now, with a twist of fate turning him from a campaigner to a candidate, on a seat with eyes across the nation trained on, this is Sharma's moment to live up to his original billing as ""high potential boy"".",Kishori Lal Sharma is the first of the cadre of youngsters recruited by Rajiv Gandhi in 1983. AICC general secretary and J&K politician Ghulam Ahmed Mir recalls that Sharma and he were very young. Mir now plans to campaign for his friend in the constituency he once managed for the party and its first family.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109846445,imgsize-1119453,width-400,resizemode-4/109846445.jpg"
