IPL franchises to discuss retentions and salary cap with BCCI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-franchises-to-discuss-retentions-and-salary-cap/articleshow/112002146.cms,"Seek option for salary increment,

mega auction

every five years instead of three and eight RTM options

Why mega auction after 5 years?

8 RTMs, an option?

Salary cap set to be increased

MUMBAI: If one of the suggestions by the franchises is implemented, the salary of a player, bought for say just Rs 30-50 lakh at the IPL mega auction in Dec this year, could be increased multiple times by the franchise-perhaps even to a few crores-if that player performs outstandingly in IPL 2025, TOI has learnt.""The current system doesn't allow for a player's salary to be increased by a franchise once he's bought in the IPL auction. Like most jobs, there's no provision of increment. Suppose he's bought for Rs 30 lakh and has an outstanding IPL, the franchise should have the option of offering him, say a Rs 3 crore fresh contract for the next year, rather than lose him to some other team. This will prevent poaching by other teams.""The IPL needs to allow franchises to renegotiate the salary of a high-performing player. It will allow a team the option to retain its best players of the previous season without the worry that they would ask to be released or traded by other teams. The players would be happy about the handsome increment, while the franchises will be pleased to avoid poaching,"" a franchise official told TOI.Among other suggestions that the franchises have put forward in their individual meetings with IPL CEO Hemang Amin and other BCCI officials are: Conduct a mega auction only once in five years, allow teams to retain five players at the most, give each franchise as many as eight right to-match (RTM) options, and increase the salary purse to around Rs 130-140 crores.The final picture of what will eventually be implemented will become clear when the BCCI holds its meeting with the IPL owners at the end of this month at the revamped BCCI office atWankhede Stadium.Explaining why it would make sense to have a mega auction after every five years, a franchise official told TOI: ""In order to ensure continuity, it makes sense to have a player auction every five years, instead of three. A longer gap between mega auctions would help teams get the best out of the players that they have invested in when they were youngsters.""It will enable us, especially those who have academies at the grassroots level, to invest in player development. For example, a young Indian player takes a couple of years to develop, and then after three years, you lose that player suddenly in the mega auction. That's just not fair.""While initially there was talk that certain franchisees want as many as eight retentions, the final figure allowed could be much lesser. ""Expect not more than five player retentions,"" a source tracking the developments told TOI. It would be interesting to see if the RTM option is given to the franchises.In May, noted cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle had revealed that Kolkata Knight Riders CEO Venky Mysore wanted the IPL governing body to allow the franchises up to eight RTM cards instead of the usual player retentions. ""Venky Mysore of KKR has come up with a workable suggestion which is that you should be allowed to retain players if they have a fair market value. So, no retentions but eight RTM cards,"" Bhogle had said on his YouTube channel.In the 2018 mega auction, a maximum of five players could be retained by each team. Of the five, three could be retained before the auction, and up to three could be bought back by a team through the RTM option in the auction. In the 2022 mega auction, when Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants entered the IPL, the eight other teams were allowed to retain four players, but the RTM options were not allowed because the BCCI wanted GT and LSG to have a larger player pool to choose from.The salary cap for each team is set to witness a massive increase-from Rs 90 crores to around Rs 130-140 crores.""It has been pending for a while. The salary cap is likely to be increased from Rs 90 crores to Rs 130-140 crores. As per the media rights agreement in 2002, IPL 2025 & 26 will see 84 matches, while IPL 2027 will include 94 matches. It means more matches, with little gaps between them. The players are bound to ask for and expect more money,"" a source said.It's also likely that there will be a discussion on the controversial Impact Player rule, though indications are that the rule may be implemented for one more year at least.",Franchises have put forward a number of suggestions to the IPL governing body. The salary cap for each team is set to witness a massive increase-from Rs 90-140 crores. The final picture of what will eventually be implemented will become clear when the BCCI holds its meeting with IPL owners this month.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112002087,imgsize-85742,width-400,resizemode-4/112002087.jpg"

PARIS: ""This way, sir."" The tall, burly man flashed a huge smile outside the Main Press Centre at the Palais des Congrès in Porte Maillot. ""Which country? Oh India. Viva India."" He kept smiling, shook hands and then suddenly turned serious. ""We need to check your bags, please. Phone, wallet, coins out in the tray."" That familiar security drill done, the first steps towards Paris 2024 had been taken.The hall on the second floor was buzzing - journalists busy on their laptops, writing stories, downloading pictures from their cameras or simply chatting over a coffee, catching up with old friends. With two days still to go for the opening ceremony on the Seine, it was house full here on Wednesday evening. Yes, the world is here.Outside in this City of Love , people are still waking up to the fact that the Olympic Games are home and so near. On arrival, the Charles de Gaulle airport was surprisingly quiet, but the volunteers were welcoming and the security check was a breeze. Fawad, the Uber driver, was the first person one got to have a conversation with. A football and basketball fan, the young man with Tunisian and Algerian roots sounded excited about the Games but was not so sure about what it meant for business.""Too much security means blocked roads. You will discover that soon. A lot of Parisians have moved out or are moving out to the city's outskirts or other towns and cities. I've got to make a living, so I am going nowhere. Paris, I hate your traffic,"" he groaned. The Zinedine Zidane fan then sighed: ""I would love to watch some football.""The Seine riverfront has been barricaded over a long stretch and traffic snarls will indeed make the already congested downtown roads difficult to move through, at least on Friday, the opening ceremony day.Alexandra, our host, said she had no such luck when asked whether she would get a paid holiday like many other Parisians over the coming fortnight. The artist who teaches contemporary dance forms moved to her father's home with her daughter and pet cat after welcoming us in.""No buzz? You may feel that it is business as usual out there on the streets, but things will change suddenly. Paris has a very vibrant sporting culture. Many of us would love to watch the opening ceremony or catch some action inside the stadiums but can't afford the tickets. We will watch it on big screens, which will come up at various places in the city. You'll be surprised by how quickly the city changes,"" she said.Outside our apartment in the Belleville neighborhood , one could see a crowd of young boys playing football in a corner, and another bunch knocking the ball around on a makeshift basketball court, shrieking and shouting in happiness. Sports does that to you, young or old - brings you unbridled joy, and sometimes a lot of pain. We will see several of these mixed emotions when it all begins in the arenas of this historic city.",The Seine riverfront has been barricaded over a long stretch and traffic snarls will indeed make the already congested downtown roads difficult to move through.

NEW DELHI: The Olympic men's football tournament saw an unprecedented start on Wednesday as Morocco shocked two-time gold medalists Argentina with a 2-1 win amid chaotic scenes in Saint-Etienne. The match concluded dramatically, marred by a nearly two-hour suspension following a pitch invasion by Moroccan fans, protesting a late goal by Argentina in the 16th minute of added time, which was eventually disallowed by VAR.The confusion peaked, leaving it unclear whether the game was paused or finished.Spectators were asked to exit the stadium, while players stayed on-site and returned to play the final three minutes of added time in an empty Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. Just before play resumed, Cristian Medina's contentious goal was disallowed for offside after a VAR review , securing Morocco's victory.The scene turned chaotic as Moroccan fans, fearing they were being deprived of a crucial victory, reacted furiously. Objects were thrown, and invading fans were tackled by security personnel on the field. Argentina players were seen flinching when a flare was tossed onto the pitch, with bottles and cups scattered across the field, forcing the game to pause.Initially, it seemed the full-time whistle had been blown, with even FIFA ’s website listing the game as over. However, an hour later, venue organizers clarified that the match was still ongoing, pending a VAR review of the disputed goal.After a prolonged delay, players returned to the field, warmed up, and waited while an official scrutinized video footage. Following a brief explanation to the Argentina team, play resumed for the final three minutes before the official final whistle was blown.Morocco had taken a 2-0 lead before Argentina began a comeback with Giuliano Simeone scoring in the 68th minute. Medina’s attempt to equalize sparked the chaotic scenes.Argentina coach Javier Mascherano expressed disbelief at the situation's handling.""I can't explain what happened. We spent about an hour and a half in the dressing room without any information on what was going to happen,"" Mascherano told reporters. He criticized the delay in the VAR decision and the subsequent play of the final three minutes, arguing that it disrupted the game's momentum.""The Moroccan captains didn't want to play, we didn't want to continue, and fans threw things at us. It's the biggest circus I've ever seen in my life, I don't know why they spent an hour and 20 minutes reviewing a play. If there is offside in Medina's goal let the game go on with the momentum we have, I don't think the game should be played for three minutes after an hour and a half,"" Mascherano added.Despite the chaos, Mascherano encouraged his team to focus on their upcoming Group B fixtures against Iraq and Ukraine.""It's no use complaining. We don't like this kind of thing to happen, but we have to turn the page, look for positive things, and aim for the two victories we need to qualify,"" he said.Argentina will face Iraq in Lyon on Saturday, looking to secure the points needed to advance in the tournament.","Morocco shocked two-time gold medalists Argentina with a 2-1 win amid chaotic scenes in Saint-Etienne.

It must have probably been from the IPL. Fitness is something that I will not agree. He played the entire IPL. He also bowled. Yes, he might not have done well (in the IPL). That's another issue.

So, fitness is something that I won't agree with,"" Srikkanth said on YouTube channel.""Suryakumar is a fantastic person. I like him. So is Hardik.

The thought behind it was that we want someone who is likely to be available more.""He was ""still a very important player,"" Agarkar said. ""And that's what we want him to be, those skill sets are hard to find.""Agarkar explained that several factors contributed to Suryakumar's selection. The player's fitness level, along with positive feedback from the team management, played a crucial role in the decision-making process.""Why Surya was made captain? Because he is one of the deserving candidates. The one we know has been around the dressing room over the last one year, you get feedback from the dressing room a lot.

Harry Brook 'won't get ahead of myself' after first home Test hundred,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/harry-brook-wont-get-ahead-of-myself-after-first-home-test-hundred/articleshow/111996762.cms,"NEW DELHI: Harry Brook , the rising star of England's cricket team, remains grounded despite achieving a significant milestone by scoring his first Test century on home soil.The 25-year-old's impressive knock of 109 was instrumental in England's commanding 241-run victory against the West Indies at Trent Bridge, giving the hosts a 2-0 lead in the three-match series.Brook's remarkable performance at Trent Bridge adds to his growing list of accomplishments, having previously scored four Test hundreds in overseas matches against Pakistan and New Zealand.His current Test batting average of 62.54 after 23 innings is the highest since the legendary Australian batsman Don Bradman , who is widely regarded as the greatest Test cricketer of all time, among players with over 1,000 runs in the format.As England prepares for the series finale at Edgbaston, Brook remains focused on his game and is determined not to be carried away by his recent success..""I've only just started,"" said Brook, as quoted by AFP. ""That could definitely fluctuate either way. I've not even played 25 innings in Test cricket yet so I won't be getting ahead of myself.""I'll just keep enjoying playing Test cricket. Hopefully I can keep it that high but if not, so be it.""Brook and his Yorkshire colleague, Joe Root , formed a formidable partnership at Trent Bridge, amassing 189 runs together. This innings also marked Root's first Test century of the current season.Having scored an impressive 363 runs against Australia in the previous year, which contributed to drawing the Ashes series , Brook expressed his appreciation for the opportunity to gain knowledge from Root. However, he also emphasized the importance of maintaining his own unique style and approach to the game.""I want to be my own batter, I want to be Harry Brook, not anybody else.""But he added: ""Rooty has just gone eighth in the all-time Test runs list, so I'd be stupid to not be tapping into his cricket knowledge.""I was glad to get it (the hundred) on the board, being my first in England.""I was nearly getting to the spot where I thought, 'God, I need a hundred in England'. I didn't get a big one in the Ashes last year, but I was happy with my performances.""Brook withdrew from the Indian Premier League earlier this year following the death of his grandmother, having previously pulled out of England's five-Test tour of India in January due to personal reasons. He later revealed his grandmother was ""ill and didn't have long left"".And it was his grandmother Pauline, one of his biggest supporters, who was uppermost in Brook's mind when he reached three figures in Nottingham.""It was the first (century) with family there and obviously loads more English fans as well, it was a very nice moment.""I'm not a massive celebrator at a hundred, I just try to soak it all in. I did it all for my grandma.""As soon as I got it, it was just like, 'Yes, a hundred'. But a couple of moments later I got a bit emotional inside, I just didn't show it. I was thinking about her.""England have four Tests left to play this season, with Sri Lanka arriving for a three-match campaign starting in August.And for Brook, an in-demand multi-format player, Test cricket is still the pinnacle.""I want to play every Test match I can for England,"" he said. ""Test cricket and playing for England is my priority.""",Harry Brook scored his first Test century on home soil against the West Indies.

The host nation put on a dominant performance to book their place in the final four.Earlier, Bangladesh set the tone with a resounding 114-run victory over Malaysia.The Bangladeshi team's impressive total of 191 for 2 was largely thanks to opener Murshida Khatun's blistering 80 off 59 balls and captain Nigar Sultana's quick-fire 62 from just 37 deliveries.Bangladesh's decision to bat first proved fruitful as Khatun and Dilara Akter, the wicket-keeper, formed a solid 65-run partnership for the first wicket. Akter contributed a valuable 33 runs before Khatun teamed up with Sultana to add another 89 runs for the second wicket, laying the groundwork for an imposing total.The Bangladeshi bowlers then took center stage, limiting Malaysia to a mere 77 runs for the loss of 8 wickets in their allotted 20 overs. This dominant performance secured Bangladesh a resounding victory and earned them a well-deserved spot in the semifinal.Thailand struggled with the bat in their final group match, only managing to score 93 for 7 after choosing to bat first.Wicket-keeper batter Nannapat Koncharoenkai top-scored for Thailand with a 53-ball 47.Sri Lanka's off-spinner Kavisha Dilhari was the standout bowler, taking 2 wickets for just 13 runs.Sri Lanka had no trouble chasing down the target, with captain Chamari Athapaththu remaining unbeaten on 49 and Vishmi Gunaratne contributing 39 not out. The Sri Lankan openers made light work of the chase, comfortably leading their team to victory.The Thailand bowlers were unable to make any significant impact against the dominant Sri Lankan batting performance.The tournament now moves to the semifinal stage, with India, the reigning champions, set to face Bangladesh, while Sri Lanka will take on Pakistan on Friday.","Sri Lanka and Bangladesh secure spots in women's Asia Cup T20 semifinals.

Chameera has been sidelined due to bronchitis and respiratory infection, which he has not fully recovered from.In light of Chameera's absence, the cricket board has called up Asitha Fernando to replace him in the squad.Fernando, also a pacer, will step in to fill the void left by Chameera's unavailability.""Dushmantha Chameera is still recovering from a bronchitis and respiratory infection he contracted, and hence will not be part of the T20I series,"" Sri Lanka Cricket tweeted.""Asitha Fernando joins the squad in place of Chameera.""Earlier today, Upul Tharanga , the chief selector of Sri Lanka, ""confirmed"" that Chameera will not participate in the upcoming six-match series, which consists of three T20Is and three ODIs.""Yesterday we got the reports, and it can be confirmed that he will miss the T20Is and ODIs against India,"" Tharanga said, as quoted by PTI, during a press in which newly appointed interim head coach Sanath Jayasuriya was also present.Asitha, 26, was the pick of the bowlers in the Lanka Premier League final, grabbing three wickets as the Jaffna Kings beat Galle Marvels.Despite making his debut in 2015 and possessing impressive pace, Chameera's career has been marred by frequent setbacks.Throughout his international career, Chameera represented Sri Lanka in 12 Tests, 52 ODIs, and 55 T20 matches, claiming 32, 56, and 55 wickets respectively. His contributions to the national team have been significant, although his appearances have been limited by injuries.Recently, Chameera missed the last few matches for Kandy Falcons in the Lanka Premier League (LPL). The exact timing and nature of his latest injury remain unclear.Chameera was absent from several significant tournaments, including the 2022 Asia Cup and the following T20 World Cup in Australia, due to a calf injury that prevented his participation.Furthermore, a shoulder injury forced him to sit out the 2023 Asia Cup, and he was originally omitted from the ODI World Cup squad last year. However, he was later added as a replacement when fellow pacer Matheesha Pathirana sustained an injury.In addition, a quadriceps injury caused him to miss the home series against Afghanistan and Bangladesh earlier this year.Although he was included in the squad for the recently-concluded T20 World Cup in the Americas, he did not feature in any of the matches.Gautam Gambhir, who has recently been appointed as the head coach of the Indian cricket team, will face his inaugural challenge during the upcoming series against Sri Lanka.The T20 portion of the tour will be held entirely in Pallekele, commencing with the first match on July 27. The second and third T20 encounters are slated for July 28 and July 30, respectively.Following the T20 series, the action will shift to Colombo for a three-match ODI series.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has argued that Hardik Pandya was relieved of his captaincy of India's T20I team due to his fitness issues. In a conversation with the Caught Behind YouTube channel, Latif dismissed these claims of Pandya's fitness issue as 'just an excuse'.The controversy emerged in the backdrop of the leadership debate after T20 World Cup-winning captain Rohit Sharma 's retirement from the shortest format of the game.Pandya subsequently lost out on the T20I captaincy to Suryakumar Yadav as decided by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) during the squad announcement for the Sri Lanka tour.Latif argued that the rationale behind questioning Pandya's fitness as a factor for his non-selection as captain is flawed, pointing out that history has seen successful captains who were not necessarily at the peak of their physical fitness.""No, here they (the claims) just hand him a certificate saying he isn't fit and there are concerns about his fitness. There are plenty of players who weren't super fit but still became great captains. So, I think it was just an excuse.

Because he is one of the deserving candidates. The one we know has been around the dressing room over the last one year. You get feedback from the dressing room a lot. He (Surya) has got a good cricketing brain and he is still one of the best T20 batters in the world,"" Agarkar told the media.Furthermore, Agarkar subtly indicated that fitness did play a role in the decision-making process, adding, ""Fitness has been something that he's struggled with. As selectors, it becomes difficult then. The thought behind it was that we want someone who is likely to be available more.""He continued, ""You want a captain that's going to be more likely to play all the games.

With a total of 873 goals throughout his illustrious career, Ronaldo's achievements include three Premier League titles, five Champions League titles, and the Euro 2016 championship. Despite turning 38 in February, the former Juventus and Manchester United star remains a prolific scorer, having netted 52 goals in 2023 for Portugal and Al-Nassr. His remarkable goal-scoring record, stemming from his evolution from a quick-footed winger to a dominant striker, sets him apart as the greatest marksman in sporting history.Often hailed as the greatest player in football history, Lionel Messi excels in both scoring and playmaking. The Argentine has amassed over 800 goals in just over 1,000 professional matches.

Bican's prolific scoring came during his time with Slavia Prague and other clubs. Despite various accounts of his goal tally, FIFA’s 2020 commemoration confirmed his impressive total. Bican's career included notable achievements in both Austrian and Czechoslovakian football.Romário, a Brazilian legend known for his clinical finishing, scored 775 goals throughout his career. Starting with Vasco da Gama, Romário went on to shine at PSV Eindhoven and Barcelona, where he was a key player in Johan Cruyff’s “Dream Team” that won the La Liga title in the 1993-1994 season.Pelé, often regarded as the greatest player of all time, scored 762 goals over his illustrious career. The three-time World Cup champion remains an iconic figure in football history, celebrated for his remarkable achievements and prolific goal-scoring abilities.Known as ‘The Galloping Major’, Ferenc Puskás was a crucial part of Hungary’s ‘Magnificent Magyars’ and Real Madrid’s 1960 European Cup-winning team. Despite his unassuming physique, Puskás scored the majority of his 729 goals with his powerful left foot from 1943 to 1966.Jimmy Jones, the highest goal-scorer in Irish League football history, scored 647 goals throughout his career. His prolific period with Glenavon, where he netted 517 goals, solidified his reputation as an unstoppable striker.FIFA’s top player in 2020 and 2021, Robert Lewandowski began his career at Dortmund and gained prominence at Bayern Munich with multiple Bundesliga records.
