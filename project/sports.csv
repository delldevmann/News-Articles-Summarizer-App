T20 World Cup

is cricket's push towards globalization, and that means opportunities for the associate teams. Those who can punch above their weight will be noticed and admired...

If you are not following what's happening around the cricket world, you can be pardoned for mistaking it as the basketball World Cup opener. United States vs Canada in Dallas - there's nothing about this fixture that suggests that a cricket World Cup is about to start.But then, that's what it is. Cricket needs its push towards globalization following its entry into the Olympics and the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) has no option but to make the World Cup of the sport's most marketable format a bit of a free-pass. Twenty teams is probably a little too much and quite a few matches in the first two weeks - 16 of which are in the USA - will stand a chance to shape up as immensely one-sided affairs.While Groups C and D have three teams each which can come close to qualification for Super 8, Groups A and B are a little too lop-sided, even if we keep the 'game of glorious uncertainties' cliché in mind. Take India's Group A for example. Yes, there's a marquee India-Pakistan game at the Nassau County ground which is important for the sport's popularity in its new found land. But India's other three opponents - Ireland, USA and Canada - over 10 days isn't exactly the fare that cricket fans are waiting for.It's most likely that a few records will be broken, some massive scores will be put up - a famous former cricketer, in fact, joked that India may enforce the follow-on in a game or two! But will it stand India in good stead when they go into Super8s, where they are likely to face New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Australia over a period of seven days?And before we get to that, there can be a case of consumer fatigue, if there are too many games which don't capture the imagination of the viewing public. It is a must to keep the fans glued to the action and one-sided cricket matches can truly be a put-off for those who are born and bred on high-intensity adrenaline rush.But then, the administrators running the sport would argue that the problem of bloat is not necessarily a cricket problem. In its bid to make the sport more ""democratic"", football World Cup has been made a 48-team event (from its present 32) from the next edition. And FIFA would flaunt the fact that Morocco's entry into the semifinals or Japan's knockout punch on Germany in the group stage of the last World Cup prove that they are on the right track. In fact, the Morocco parallel came up for discussion when minnows Afghanistan were in the middle of a brilliant run in the ODI World Cup in India last October-November.When Afghanistan beat Pakistan in the league stage in Chennai following a big chase, the Afghan coach Jonathan Trott was asked whether they would like to be called ""the Morocco of cricket"". ""We want to be the best version of ourselves. But to remain competitive we have to play more against the best teams in the business,"" Trott had said as his Afghan warriors briefly threatened to qualify for the semis.It is a similar story that the ICC is hoping from this World Cup as well. Of course, no one wants the supremely popular India to lose before semifinals, but the emergence of a new nation in cricket is long overdue.The USA have a team full of Indian and Pakistani-origin players who couldn't make it big back home. While it will be some story if they can pull off the odd upset, Ireland on their day have the ability to trouble top teams. Nepal is another country where cricket is immensely popular and they have made some giant strides in recent times, but the beautiful story of this World Cup can be Uganda.The small and poor African nation has made the T20 World Cup and most of its players have grown up in slums of Kampala, nurturing the dream that cricket will be a gate-pass to better lives.They have an Indian coach in Abhay Sharma, who was the captain of a Ranji Trophy winning Railways side, and he said that he didn't have an idea before taking up the job that some of these players have gone through such hardships. ""These guys have immense respect for coaches. They think we can change their lives,"" Sharma said during an interview recently from Trinidad and Tobago, where the team was preparing for the World Cup.If a team like Uganda pull off an upset or Afghanistan go on to play the semifinals, we should all be happy. Of course, we will have the usual suspects who will flex their muscles as the tournament gets to its business end. India's fortunes will obviously become the talking point while teams like Australia and South Africa will look to dominate with their no-holds-barred cricket.West Indies, at home, too should dish out their Calypso flair and in the middle of all these, a beautiful underdog story would become the cherry on top that the sport needs to become a global brand.",Cricket needs its push towards globalization following its entry into the Olympics. ICC has no option but to make the World Cup of the sport's most marketable format a bit of a free-pass.

DARK HORSE:

There was a prediction by the pundits commentating in the IPL about the semi-finalists for the T20 World Cup and each one of them had India in their list. Rohit Sharma 's boys have the balance - brilliant technicians, quality power-hitters, top spinners and an outstanding Jasprit Bumrah . It is a team that is good for all conditions and it's only about things falling into place for them to be there at the business end.A team full of confidence. They have won everything that is there to be won and this team too doesn't lack variety. Australia are built on their ability to explode with the bat while the likes of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Adam Zampa have the quality to rise with the ball when the occasion demands. The fact that the team has nothing more to prove can make them just a bit more dangerous.Though mired with racism issues all over again, South Africa are quietly building a formidable limited overs team following the Aussie template of power-hitters and some quality bowlers. The likes of Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Tristan Stubbs are destructive hitters who can simply take the game away from any opposition on their day.The team is nurturing the hurt of a disastrous ODI World Cup campaign. Their captainJos Buttler got their players to return from IPL well before the playoffs, which shows how serious the veteran is to turn things around. England also have a nice mix of youth and experience, some big-hitters and quality white-ball bowlers who know what it is to deliver on a big stage. And if Jofra Archer gets back to his best, England can shape up into one of the top contenders for the title.West Indies: On paper, they don't look the best team, but home conditions and an element of unpredictability make them a force to reckon with. And when a team has power hitters like Nicholas Pooran, Rovman Powell, Andre Russell and Shimron Hetmyer, there's no option but to take them seriously.","Rohit Sharma's boys have the balance - brilliant technicians, quality power- hitters, top spinners and an outstanding Jasprit Bumrah.

NEW DELHI: Real Madrid secured a record-extending 15th Champions League title with a 2-0 victory over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley Stadium .The Spanish side, known for their resilience and experience in high-stakes matches, weathered a dominant first-half performance from Dortmund before capitalizing on their opportunities in the second half.Dortmund, appearing in their first Champions League final since 2013, started brightly and created numerous scoring chances. Karim Adeyemi, Niclas Füllkrug, Julian Brandt, and Marcel Sabitzer all came close to breaking the deadlock, but Thibaut Courtois, in his fifth appearance of an injury-interrupted season, produced several crucial saves to keep Real Madrid level.Despite Dortmund's early pressure, Real Madrid remained composed and gradually grew into the game in the second half. Toni Kroos tested Gregor Kobel with a free-kick before Dani Carvajal broke the deadlock in the 74th minute, heading in a Kroos corner.The goal shifted the momentum decisively in Real Madrid's favour. Vinicius Jr. doubled their lead in the 83rd minute, finishing clinically after being released by Jude Bellingham's misplaced pass. Although Füllkrug had a late goal ruled out for offside, Dortmund were unable to mount a comeback.The victory marked Real Madrid's sixth Champions League title in 11 seasons, a testament to their sustained dominance in the competition.Carlo Ancelotti , already a two-time Champions League winner as a player with AC Milan, secured his fifth title as a manager, further cementing his legacy as one of the most successful coaches in the tournament's history.Dortmund, with their energetic pressing and direct attacking play, posed a significant threat, particularly in the first half. However, Real Madrid's experience, tactical discipline, and clinical finishing ultimately proved decisive. Their ability to absorb pressure and punish opponents on the counter-attack, a hallmark of their recent successes, was once again on full display.","Real Madrid secure a record-extending 15th Champions League title with a 2-0 victory over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley Stadium.

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant and all-round Hardik Pandya hogged the spotlight as India brushed aside Bangladesh in the T20 World Cup warm-up match in New York on Saturday.In the comfortable 60-run win, India had several positive aspects, with Pant's fifty being the most significant.Pant's impressive performance (53 off 32 balls, including 4 fours and 4 sixes) and Hardik's valuable contribution with both bat and ball (40 not out off 23 balls, with 2 fours and 4 sixes) propelled India to a solid 182 for five after choosing to bat first.Defending the total proved to be a straightforward task as left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh-led India restricted Bangladesh to 122 for nine.Despite a brief resistance from Mahmudullah Riyaz (40 retired out; 28b, 4x4, 1x6) and Shakib Al Hasan (28), who added 75 runs for the sixth wicket, Bangladesh could only manage to reduce the margin of defeat after being reduced to 41 for five.Arshdeep, who had a subpar IPL season with Punjab Kings, struck twice within the Powerplay, dismissing Soumya Sarkar and Litton Das.Mohammed Siraj added to Bangladesh's woes by removing skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto (0), leaving them reeling at 10 for three in 3.5 overs.The Indian bowlers showcased their skills in exploiting the slow pitch and sluggish outfield, with pacer Shivam Dube also contributing two wickets (2/11).Bangladesh's lackluster batting performance highlighted the significance of Pant and Hardik's innings.Pant's knock has likely secured his position as the first-choice wicketkeeper-batter for India in the World Cup, giving him an edge over Sanju Samson.Samson, who opened the innings with skipper Rohit Sharma (23, 19b, 2x4, 1x6) in place of Virat Kohli, struggled to adapt to the pitch conditions and was dismissed for a 6-ball 1 by left-arm pacer Shoriful Islam.Suryakumar Yadav (31, 18b, 4x4) and Pandya (40) also made valuable contributions to India's competitive total.Pant's exceptional touch, which he displayed during the IPL 2024 for Delhi Capitals, continued in this match as he played his characteristic shots and brought up his fifty in just 32 balls.Hardik, who was dropped on 26, provided the necessary acceleration by smashing three consecutive sixes off left-arm spinner Tanvir Islam, showcasing his power and execution.His innings and confidence might have immensely pleased the team management and himself after a modest outing as Mumbai Indians' captain in a season where he was subjected to intense professional and personal scrutiny.Bangladesh also suffered an injury scare as Shoriful walked off just before bowling the final ball of the innings, as Tanzim Hasan completed the over.","India beat Bangladesh by 60 runs in T20 World Cup warm-up match in New York.

Once you get in, you can start using your power. When you hit it out of the park, it's called a Home Run in baseball, in cricket, it's called a six.""I think, in baseball, there is less time -- after three strikes, you are out.

NEW DELHI: Indian chess prodigy R Praggnanandhaa achieved a significant victory by defeating world number one Magnus Carlsen in a classical game format. This match, which took place during the third round of the tournament, marked Praggnanandhaa's first classical win against Carlsen.At just 18 years of age, Praggnanandhaa displayed his mettle on Carlsen's home ground, leading the open section of the six-player tournament after this victory.Utilizing the white pieces, Praggnanandhaa, who was the runner-up in the previous year's FIDE Chess World Cup, executed a series of strategic moves to secure the win. Following this round, Praggnanandhaa led with a score of 5.5 out of nine points, while Carlsen dropped to the fifth position in the tournament standings.Prior to this encounter, Praggnanandhaa had recorded victories over Carlsen in both rapid and blitz chess formats. The second round of the Norway Chess tournament saw all classical games ending in draws, with Carlsen, Alireza Firouzja, and Ding Liren winning their respective Armageddon games to each earn 1.5 points.Praggnanandhaa, who had previously led 2-0 against World Champion Ding Liren, reached his first classical draw in this round before Ding Liren won the Armageddon tie-breaker.""I wish Magnus would take similar risks against us old folks,"" said Hikaru Nakamura on Carlsen's choice of playing a risky battle against Praggnanandhaa.The tournament also featured a closely contested classical game between Magnus Carlsen and Nakamura, which concluded in a draw. Carlsen later won theArmageddon game , demonstrating his skill in high-pressure situations and securing a lead in the tournament.Alireza Firouzja and Fabiano Caruana also drew their classical game, with Firouzja winning the subsequent Armageddon game.In the Norway Chess Women's Tournament, Vaishali R defeated Koneru Humpy , marking her first classical win against India's top female player.

T20 World Cup: Can Hardik Pandya still be a game-changer?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-can-hardik-pandya-still-be-a-game-changer/articleshow/110608403.cms,"The mercurial allrounder, who suffered a torrid & controversial

as the new

captain, needs to put his recent travails behind him & rise to the occasion in the

T20 World Cup

...

In the World Cup, will Hardik Pandya find himself on the crest or in the trough of his rollercoaster career? The Pandya situation is no doubt being handled with utmost care in the Team India camp right now. Coach Rahul Dravid and captain Rohit Sharma will be eager to get the best out of one of India's most important T20 contributors and the only true seam-bowling allrounder in the ranks.Pandya is also vice-captain of the team, another appointment dogged by controversy and mired in innuendo, like everything else with the cricketer lately. It's not Pandya's credentials that are under the scanner. He has been retained in Grade A in the BCCI 's central contracts list in spite of recurring injuries since 2018. Having played only in the IPL following an ankle injury during the ODI World Cup late last year, the entire focus should have been on the cricketer's quest to regain peak fitness in time for the big one.Instead, his world seems to be unravelling around him.Both Pandya's private life and public persona have come under such intense scrutiny in recent times that often, from the outside, it has seemed things are at breaking point. It's a curious turn of events for one of the most colourful, exciting and emotional cricketers India has ever produced, one who possesses both rare skill and naked ambition.Since he burst on to the scene for Mumbai Indians in 2015, Pandya has not shied away from showcasing the kind of swagger that can attract the wrong kind of attention. People may scoff at his extravagant ways but having seen some real hard times growing up, Pandya is entitled to live it up if he wants to. He has chosen to be all flash and glitter. He has lived life on his terms.At times that has got him into trouble too, like when he was suspended for some ill-conceived comments on a TV talk show. This recent implosion in the Mumbai Indians camp and the hostility of spectators, however, has been particularly unsettling to watch. Fans across venues have raged against Pandya and rained slurs on him. They seemed incensed by Pandya's switch from Gujarat Titans and the dethroning of the more popular Rohit Sharma as Mumbai Indians captain.Then again, the trigger may well be Hardik's loud public persona.Either way you see it, this public castigation of Pandya across stadiums has showcased the worst of the IPL's oddball fan-loyalties at play.It could also be the management's choice to overlook the optics altogether. CSK, after all, underwent a similar transition and there wasn't a peep from the crowds. Cricketers routinely switch club loyalties in the auction process and there is no outcry. To the fans, the MI captaincy swap may have seemed like a midnight coup.The appointment as MI captain seemed plagued with trouble from the start. The likes of Suryakumar Yadav and Jasprit Bumrah - among four players from the MI setup in the World Cup squad - have seemingly, in cryptic social-media posts, expressed displeasure at being overlooked. It seemed even Rohit Sharma, having been named India's captain for the T20 World Cup in a surprise return to the old guard, had been caught unawares.Many ex-cricketers thought Pandya was faking and blustering his way through the doomed campaign, that his leadership style was muddled. Kevin Pietersen said Pandya was ""smiling too much"" and ""trying to act like he's happy"" when ""everything away from the game was affecting him so much"". Graeme Smith said MI have been a ""very confused team"".Pandya may have thought he was the most hated Indian cricketer ever. There may have been moments when he lost direction.After a loss to CSK, Pandya alluded to Dhoni's presence in the opposition and said, ""There's a man behind the stumps who tells them what's working."" This spurred Adam Gilchrist to say, ""That line about Dhoni is interesting. It tells that maybe Pandya is feeling a bit of a lone wolf.""AB de Villiers said he loved Pandya but ""his captaincy style is quite bravado. It's ego-driven, chest out"".Perhaps Pandya was too abrasive for Mumbai Indians, even though the style may have worked at Gujarat Titans. The public criticism of Tilak Varma for not taking on DC's Axar Patel and whispers of an alleged dressing room showdown did not help either. MI coach Mark Boucher admitted in the end that all the happenings may have ""clouded"" Pandya.All chief selector Ajit Agarkar would say about Pandya's selection is, ""The good part we have looked at is that he has got through all the games so far for MI.""That, however, doesn't answer the question - is Pandya in the best frame of mind to perform at his peak in a tournament like this? The relentless antagonism from spectators also spurred an ongoing social-media trial that puts him under immense pressure to perform in the World Cup.In one of his rare moments of candour, Pandya said, ""We've seen better days but seen worse days as well. I don't think these things surprise me anymore.""If there's one cricketer who swears by his resilience, it's Hardik Pandya. His first post after joining the India squad in the US contained the words: ""On national duty.""Remember, India have had alleged flare-ups between captain and vice-captain in a T20 World Cup before, back in 2009, when Dhoni paraded the whole team in front of the media to quell reports of a rift in the team.This time, the calming presence of both Rohit and Dravid may serve to erase any lingering bitterness. Team India needs Pandya to step up to win the World Cup. He was, after all, their best performer with the bat in that semifinal defeat to England in Adelaide in 2022.",Hardik Pandya's world seems to be unravelling around him. Fans across venues have raged against Pandya and rained slurs on him. Pandya has been retained in Grade A in the BCCI's central contracts list in spite of recurring injuries since 2018.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110608384,imgsize-46412,width-400,resizemode-4/110608384.jpg"

Cristiano Ronaldo was overcome with emotion as he departed the field in tears following Al-Nassr 's defeat to Al-Hilal in the King’s Cup final in Saudi Arabia, marking another season without major silverware for his team.In a tense showdown in Jeddah that concluded 1-1 after extra time, Al-Hilal clinched victory in a penalty shootout, prevailing 5-4. Ronaldo, who joined Al-Nassr in December 2022, was visibly distraught, collapsing to the ground before being comforted by his teammates at King Abdullah Sports City.The disappointment came after the conclusion of the Saudi Pro League four days ago, where Al-Nassr finished second, trailing Al-Hilal by 14 points. Ronaldo's individual achievement of setting a new league record with 35 goals provided some solace, but it was not enough to offset the team's longing for the championship.The final match was marked by intensity, witnessing two goals and three red cards. Al-Hilal took an early lead with Aleksandar Mitrovic's header after just seven minutes. Al-Nassr suffered a setback in the second half when goalkeeper David Ospina was ejected for handling the ball outside the area.The drama escalated when Ali Al-Bulaihi of Al-Hilal was also sent off for a headbutt on Sami Al-Najei. Al-Nassr seized the opportunity, equalizing with Ayman Yahya's header moments later.As tensions soared, Al-Hilal's Kalidou Koulibaly received his second yellow card, reducing his team to ten men. After the stalemate in extra time, the fate of the match was decided by a penalty shootout.Although both teams missed their initial attempts, Ronaldo converted his penalty. However, Al-Hilal emerged victorious as Bounou saved crucial penalties from Ali Al-Hassan and Al-Nemer, securing their 11th King’s Cup title.For Ronaldo and his team, the wait for silverware continues into the next season.","Al-Nassr lost 5-4 on penalties to Al-Hilal in the King's Cup final in Jeddah.

NEW DELHI: Inter Miami and St. Louis City played out a thrilling 3-3 draw on Saturday night at DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The match, a rollercoaster of lead changes and dramatic moments, saw both teams showcase their attacking prowess while also exposing defensive vulnerabilities.Jordi Alba was the standout performer for Inter Miami, registering a goal and two assists in a dynamic display. His contributions proved crucial in securing a point for the home side, who extended their impressive run to just one loss in their last twelve MLS matches.The match began with Inter Miami dominating possession, but it was St. Louis who struck first. In the 15th minute, Chris Durkin capitalized on a set-piece opportunity, firing a right-footed shot past Drake Callender to give the visitors an early lead.Inter Miami responded swiftly, showcasing the lethal partnership developing between Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba.

NEW DELHI: The inaugural match of the 2023 T20 World Cup unfolded at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas, marking a significant moment for both participating nations and the sport itself.This encounter between the United States and Canada represented the first time either team graced the global stage of a T20 World Cup, and it simultaneously inaugurated the tournament's debut on American soil.Despite earlier concerns regarding inclement weather, the coin toss, won by USA captain Monank Patel who elected to field first, took place under clear evening skies.This set the stage for a highly anticipated clash, amplified by the fact that the USA and West Indies are jointly hosting this edition of the tournament, a testament to the ICC's commitment to expanding cricket 's global footprint.The United States entered the match as slight favourites, buoyed by their recent series victory against Bangladesh, a result that underscored their growing prowess in the shortest format of the game. This confidence was further bolstered by their favourable head-to-head record against Canada in recent encounters.Adding to the historical significance of the occasion, this T20 World Cup features an expanded format, with 20 teams vying for the coveted trophy.

NEW DELHI: Swashbuckling Rishabh Pant strengthened his case for a spot in India's starting XI the T20 World Cup as the primary wicketkeeper batter with a fluid half-century, guiding his side to a solid 182 for five against Bangladesh in the warm-up match in New York on Saturday.Pant, who was returning to the Indian side after a horrific car accident in December 2022, retired after scoring 53 runs off 32 balls, including four fours and four sixes, on a slightly sluggish pitch.The innings has likely given Pant an advantage over Sanju Samson in the perceived competition for the wicketkeeper-batter position.Samson, who had an impressive IPL season with Rajasthan Royals, also played in the match as an opener alongside captain Rohit Sharma (23, 19b, 2x4, 1x6), as Virat Kohli, who was expected to open but sat out the match after arriving in New York only on Friday.However, Samson was dismissed for just 1 run off 6 balls, trapped in front by left-arm pacer Shoriful Islam.Suryakumar Yadav (31, 18b, 4x4) and Hardik Pandya (40 not out, 23b, 2x4, 4x6) also made valuable contributions as India reached a competitive total despite the absence of any significant partnerships in their innings. Pant, however, was the primary architect of the fighting total.Pant, who returned to competitive cricket during the IPL 2024, displayed excellent form for Delhi Capitals, scoring 287 runs from 13 matches with three half-centuries at a strike rate of 155.The left-hander continued his fine touch in the warm-up match, punishing the Bangladesh bowlers with his unique and hard-to-describe shots.Pant, who hit Shakib Al Hasan for two consecutive sixes, reached his fifty in 32 balls with a boundary off Shakib before retiring.Shivam Dube, who was dropped on four, failed to capitalize on the opportunity and was dismissed for 14 off 16 balls, leaving India at 130 for four after 14.4 overs.India needed some acceleration, and Pandya delivered just that. Despite being dropped on 26, Pandya smashed three consecutive sixes off left-arm spinner Tanvir Islam, showcasing his power and precise execution.His innings and confidence would have greatly pleased the team management and himself, especially after a modest performance as Mumbai Indians' captain in a season where he faced intense professional and personal scrutiny.Bangladesh also experienced an early scare when Islam walked off just before bowling the final ball of the innings, with Tanzim Hasan completing the over.Now, it's up to the Indian bowlers to address a few concerns ahead of their World Cup opener against Ireland on June 5 in New York.","Rishabh Pant scores 53 runs off 32 balls, including four fours and four sixes.

'It's been a chaotic kind of start': Mitchell Santner on New Zealand's T20 WC preparations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/its-been-a-chaotic-kind-of-start-mitchell-santner-on-new-zealands-t20-wc-preparations/articleshow/110625256.cms,"(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Acknowledging New Zealand's tumultuous beginning to the T20 World Cup 2024, star all-rounder Mitchell Santner revealed that the squad faced a disorganized start.This was primarily due to logistical challenges, prompting the team to prioritize additional training sessions over an official warm-up game. Compounded by players arriving in three separate batches due to their commitments in the Indian Premier League ( IPL ), the Kiwi team encountered initial hurdles.Nevertheless, following several days of rigorous training in Trinidad, Santner expressed confidence that New Zealand can now ""really settle in"" as they transition to Guyana. It is in Guyana where they will commence their campaign with a crucial group stage encounter against Afghanistan on June 8th.""It's been a chaotic kind of start with people coming in at different times. It was nice to get home for a few days before travelling with the team to come over here, had a nice little time in Trinidad. One training kind of got rained out. But we are here now in Guyana, a good week or so to get some good prep done for our first game,"" Santner said as quoted by ESPNcricinfo.""They always put on a good party in the West Indies. I guess not having any warm-up games and guys coming in at different times, it kind of felt a little distorted. We are here in Guyana, we can really settle in with the tournament starting tomorrow. We can watch a little bit of start and then see what the pitches are going to do, especially in Guyana, and do our prep accordingly for our first game,"" he added.The upcoming World Cup is set to unfold across nine diverse venues spanning the Caribbean and the United States. New Zealand's itinerary includes one Group C match in Guyana and three in Tarouba.Reflecting on the tournament's expansive nature, Santner noted a sense of the ""unknown"" surrounding the competition, particularly with the inclusion of teams like Uganda and Papua New Guinea alongside cricketing powerhouses such as the West Indies and Afghanistan.""It's obviously good to watch [the first few games]. I think that's going to be a common theme in the World Cup, you know, different places will play very differently. Traditionally, Guyana can be a little bit slow and Trinidad can be pretty good. America is going to be different. So teams have to assess and adapt quickly throughout the whole tournament,"" he said.In addition to this, New Zealand will lean on the expertise of seasoned players like Kane Williamson , James Neesham, Glenn Phillips , and Ish Sodhi, all of whom boast experience in the Caribbean Premier League. Their familiarity with the conditions will be invaluable in guiding the team through the challenges of the tournament.""As a squad, we have guys who played a lot. And then there are few guys who know these conditions. Glenn has played a lot of CPL and a few other boys as well.

When we played in Australia where we didn't qualify, everyone was hurt. I resigned (from) captaincy after that as well. Everyone was hurt. But we are no longer that group of guys. We all know what's at stake here. """"We all know that we have an opportunity to obviously redeem ourselves, make our cricket fans in the Caribbean and our cricket fans all over the world proud of us [and] happy. This time around we are much better players as well. Most of our guys that play franchise cricket, they understand what is needed to be a professional as well,"" Pooran told ESPNCricinfo.Pooran emphasized that the team has grown and matured since then with players understanding the importance of professionalism and what is required to succeed.West Indies, who are co-hosting the tournament with the USA, have a rich history in the competition, having won two titles under Daren Sammy's leadership in 2012 and 2016.Sammy has now taken on the role of head coach for the upcoming tournament, where the team will face Papua New Guinea in Guyana on Sunday.""Coming back in here after two years, everybody wants to get that special feeling we had when we won those two T20 World Cups. I feel like everybody wants that moment again. They want to be a part of that winning feeling. Doing it in front of our fans is even more special,"" added Pooran.The West Indies lineup boasts several big-hitters, including Pooran, captain Powell, Shimron Hetmyer, Sherfane Rutherford, and Romario Shepherd, making it a formidable force.Additionally, Andre Russell joins the team fresh off an impressive performance in the Indian Premier League (IPL), where he played a crucial role in Kolkata Knight Riders' third IPL title win last week in Chennai.""He's a winner. He wins T20 games. He wins tournaments and whenever you have that experience in the dressing room, it helps a lot, especially in a World Cup. Experience is key. We have Rovy (Powell), we have Hetmyer, we have Rutherford, we have Sheppy (Shepherd).""These guys have been doing brilliantly for themselves and their franchises and West Indies in the last 12 months.

NEW DELHI: Borussia Dortmund coach Edin Terzic believes ""anything is possible"" as his team prepares to face the formidable Real Madrid in the Champions League final at London's Wembley Stadium on Saturday.Real Madrid enters the final as heavy favorites, aiming to secure their 15th European title and sixth in the last 11 seasons. They face a Dortmund side that has already defied expectations by reaching the final.Despite Real Madrid's dominance this season, having lost just twice in 54 games and clinched the La Liga title with a 10-point lead, they had to overcome significant challenges to reach the Champions League final, as described by coach Carlo Ancelotti .""We have to enjoy being here,"" said Ancelotti at his pre-match press conference. ""But knowing it can go wrong because we are close to the most important thing in football – winning a Champions League – but having the fear this can escape us.""Ancelotti's squad showcased resilience by overcoming defending champions Manchester City on penalties in the quarter-finals and staging a legendary late comeback against Bayern Munich in the semi-finals at the Santiago Bernabeu.""We never stop believing, no matter how the circumstances are,"" said Luka Modric . Along with Nacho, Dani Carvajal, and Toni Kroos—playing his final match for the club—Modric could win the European Cup for a record-equalling sixth time. ""We always believe, keep believing, keep pushing, fighting until the end. In the end, we manage to find a way to beat opponents. Many people say there is luck, but when it happens so many times, I think it's not just luck.""Borussia Dortmund faces the challenge of overcoming a significant financial gap with Real Madrid as they aim to secure their second Champions League title. Last season, Madrid boasted record revenues of 831 million euros ($901 million), while Dortmund's stood at 420 million euros, according to Deloitte.The trajectory of Jude Bellingham 's career underscores Dortmund's challenge. Initially signed from English Championship side Birmingham as a teenager, Bellingham was developed by Dortmund before being transferred to Madrid for over 100 million euros a year ago. Dortmund struggled in the Bundesliga this season, finishing fifth and trailing Bayer Leverkusen by 27 points.Despite these challenges, Terzic's team has excelled in the Champions League, reaching the final for the third time and the first since their defeat to Bayern Munich at Wembley 11 years ago. Dortmund emerged as the victors of a challenging group that included Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan, and Newcastle. They then defeated PSV Eindhoven and Atletico Madrid before a remarkable defensive effort secured a victory over PSG in the semi-finals.""They are the favourites but we don’t care,"" said Terzic. ""We haven’t been the favourites against Atletico or against PSG. But if we are brave and not here to watch Real Madrid lift the trophy, if we are here to give them a game, then we have a chance.""Despite Dortmund being allocated only 30,000 tickets for the 90,000-capacity stadium, over 100,000 fans are estimated to have traveled to London. UEFA will aim to keep the focus on the on-field action, hoping their choice of Wembley for the final won't be scrutinized. The Euro 2020 final saw violence as ticketless fans breached the stadium, prompting the English Football Association to invest £5 million ($6 million) in enhancing safety and infrastructure at Wembley. Wembley is also scheduled to host the Euro 2028 final.","Borussia Dortmund coach Edin Terzic believes ""anything is possible"" as his team prepares to face the formidable Real Madrid in the Champions League final at London's Wembley Stadium.

NEW DELHI: India goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu emphasized the need for other players to step up and lead the national team forward following the retirement of iconic captain and striker Sunil Chhetri . As the team convened for training ahead of the crucial World Cup qualifier against Kuwait on June 6, which marks Chhetri's final international appearance, Sandhu expressed the responsibility lying on the players to fill the void left by the departing legend.During a media interaction at the National Centre of Excellence, Sandhu stated, ""The onus is on the players to take up the mantle. Eventually, this was going to happen, and we have to learn to cope without him (Chhetri). We have also experienced playing without Sunil Bhai in some matches in the past. It's not that we have done really badly; we need to manage things without him.

But Sunil bhai has given us the blueprint, the map, and if you follow that you may not become the next Chhetri but can come close enough to his greatness.""India's journey in the World Cup qualifiers has seen highs and lows, starting with a historic 1-0 away victory over Kuwait, their first in over two decades.

This achievement would mark a significant milestone for Indian football , promising further challenges and opportunities on the international stage.Gurpreet reiterated the importance of maintaining normalcy and consistent preparation, expressing hope that Chhetri's winning goal against Kuwait would serve as a fitting farewell.""Everything is pretty normal, and we are keeping it that way.

NEW DELHI: Former U.S. coach Jill Ellis hailed FIFA 's recent approval of new pay regulations designed to assist female players and coaches during pregnancy, adoption, and maternity leave as a significant stride forward for women balancing their careers with motherhood.The FIFA Council unanimously approved these regulations earlier this month. Notably, the minimum 14 weeks of paid maternity leave for players has now been extended to coaches as well. Additionally, players and coaches who adopt a child will be eligible for eight weeks of paid absence if the adopted child is under two years old.A female player or coach who is not the biological mother will be entitled to a minimum of eight weeks of family leave under the new regulations.Furthermore, the updated rules will enable women to receive full pay even when they are absent from training or matches due to menstrual problems. Additionally, teams will be encouraged to facilitate more contact between female players and their families while on international duty.""A football career shouldn't be exclusive of being a mum or raising a child, it should be inclusive of that,"" said Ellis, who coached the U.S. women's team to World Cup victories in 2015 and 2019. ""If I didn't have support around me, I wouldn't have had the ability to do that and maintain my career.""""These are big steps and big strides to really normalize the life that we go through as women … that's what we want to provide now at every level, the club level, the national team level –- the opportunity for pro players to have the chance to be mums,"" added Ellis, who led FIFA's Technical Study Group at the 2023 Women's World Cup.According to the new regulations, clubs are permitted to register players outside of the usual registration periods to serve as temporary replacements for female players who are on maternity leave, adoption leave , or family leave. Additionally, players who are returning to soccer following any of these reasons can also be registered outside of the regular registration period.""When you're playing sport for a living, and in a professional environment, we have to factor in that the female menstrual cycle can also impact on your ability to deliver within your role,"" said Sarai Bareman , FIFA's Chief Football Women's Officer.""So, it's important that we protect those that are affected by their menstrual cycles in a way that it doesn't put at risk their employment situation with their club and, ultimately, their ability to earn money.""Member associations will also be encouraged to allow female players to have contact with their families while on international duty, an important move for mothers, said Bareman, who can be away from their children for as long as six weeks while on World Cup duty.""That can have a big toll on the player, mentally, but also on the child,"" she said. ""So, encouraging the member associations to make provision or to allow for those mothers to have children with them during the camp, during the tournament, is a really important step which will support not only female players but all players in our sport.""The new updates to the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players will go into effect on Saturday.",FIFA Council unanimously approved new pay regulations earlier this month.

However, the encounter was not without its unusual moments, as a distressed pigeon briefly halted play in the fourth set, prompting a compassionate intervention from chair umpire Damien Dumusois .During a changeover with Medvedev leading 2-1 in the fourth set, a pigeon landed on the clay court near the Russian's chair.

It was not looking good. I think maybe something (wrong) with the wing.""The delay, though unintentional, seemingly provided Medvedev with a welcome opportunity to catch his breath during the demanding match. ""I was like, oh my God, if it gives me an extra minute to breathe, it would be perfect and it did,"" he admitted.Recognizing the bird's distress, umpire Dumusois took it upon himself to assist. He descended from his chair and approached the pigeon cautiously, ultimately using a towel to carefully capture the bird.The pigeon, attempting to break free, hopped away from Dumusois, but the umpire's persistence paid off as he successfully secured the bird and passed it to a tournament official waiting courtside.This act of compassion drew warm applause from the spectators present on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, demonstrating appreciation for Dumusois' quick thinking and gentle handling of the situation.While the pigeon incident provided a memorable anecdote, the primary focus remained on the on-court battle. Medvedev, despite facing a spirited challenge from Machac, ultimately proved too strong, securing victory after three hours and 22 minutes of play.","Daniil Medvedev beat Tomas Machac 7-6(3) 6-4 6-3 6-2 in the third round of the French Open.
