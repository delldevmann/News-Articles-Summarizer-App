Concerns are also being raised about Babar Azam's captaincy. He was reinstated as skipper before the tournament.He had relinquished the captaincy following a poor ODI World Cup campaign last year.In a post-match press conference after the game against Ireland, Babar addressed the captaincy issue. He stated that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) would review the campaign at home and decide on the team's future leadership. Babar emphasized that his reinstatement as captain was a decision made solely by the PCB .""Jahaan tak captaani ki dekhe toh pahle maine chori toh mujhe laga ki ab nahi karni chahiye, toh maine chor di. Maine khud announce kiya tha. Wapas jab diya hai woh PCB ka faisla hai, unhone di hai. Ab hum jayenge, jitni bhi yahaan huwi hai baithke discussion karenge aur yeh faisla baad me.. Jab chorni hogi toh main aise hi khule aam bataunga, jo hoga saamne hoga. Filhaal ispe maine kuch socha nahi hai. Jo faisla hai woh PCB karegi,"" Babar said.Babar expressed his disappointment regarding the team’s early exit from the T20 World Cup. He acknowledged that the team as a whole failed to perform rather than pointing fingers at individual players. He noted that the team struggled to synchronize their performances; when the bowlers performed well, the batting lineup faltered.""Dukh jitna aap ko hai, usse jyada humein hai. Players, management sabko dukh hai. Hum waisi cricket nahi khel paaye, jaise expect karni chahiye thi. Jis tarah ke hamare players the, waise hum performance nahi kar paye. Toh mere khayal se, hum as a team achcha nahi khele. Yeh nahi ki kisi ek bande ki wajah se hum haare. As a team hum haare. As a team hum click nahi kar paye. Kabhi humne bowling me achcha kiya, kabhi humne batting me acha nahi kiya,"" Babar added.While discussing the conditions, Babar admitted that the pitches slightly favored fast bowlers, but the primary issue was their batting failures in critical moments. He pointed out that losing wickets back-to-back put them in a difficult position in crucial matches.""Yahaan par jo pitches thi who fast bowlers ko thoda sa help kar rahi thi. Humari batting waise click nahi kar payi. Jab humare hathon ki cheez aayi, wahan par humne wicket lose ki, jiske bajah se do crucial match the woh haare. Hum ahead jaa rahe the, pressure dusre team me thi lekin jab aap back-to-back wicket girti hai toh pressure aap pe aa jati hai,"" Babar said.The Pakistan skipper's comments reflect a broader team failure rather than individual shortcomings. His focus is now on returning home and having thorough discussions to determine the way forward for Pakistan cricket. The future of his captaincy remains in the hands of the PCB, and a decision is expected after the campaign review.",Pakistan wrapped up their 2024 ICC T20 World Cup journey with a narrow three- wicket win over Ireland in their final Group A match in Florida on Sunday.

MIAMI: It's travel time. The American duty is over for India and now we're into what matters most --the Super-8 in the West Indies There wasn't everything perfect about the US leg - bad pitches, poor outfield, washed out game - but India didn't find it too tough to cross the first hurdle of the month-long marathon. Now it's Afghanistan , Bangladesh and Australia in Barbados, Antigua and St Lucia respectively. And with two teams going ahead from the group --Rohit Sharma's boys should be there in Guyana for the semifinal on June 27.With their last league game against Canada at Fort Lauderdale getting washed out without a ball being bowled, Team India players got a bit of time to put their feet up and relax. But with no practice also possible since their last match in New York on June 12, batting coach Vikram Rathour sounded a little worried.""This was of course not ideal. We would have preferred to build on the momentum and this was the game to express ourselves. But there's not much we can do about it,"" Rathour said.The Indian team will hit the nets in Barbados on June 17 to prepare for their game against Afghanistan --a team that has been in fine form so far. But much like India, they, too, haven't played in Barbados and will have to adapt to conditions. The England vs Australia game was played at the Kensington Oval where the Aussies had plundered 201 and then leggie Adam Zampa got 2/28 to become Man of the Match.Unlike Nassau County Ground in New York, where India played their three games, the Kensington Oval pitch should be batting-friendly and with no dew in the equation, the spinners, too, could come in handy.It's to be seen whether India stick to the four-pacer theory or drop Mohammed Siraj, whose form has been slightly up and down, and play Kuldeep Yadav as the third spinner. Rathour kept the options open when he said: ""We need to be a flexible team. We need to look at the conditions that are in front of us and be ready to deal with those. We'll react to what we get on that day and we have the resources to deal with any condition,"" Rathour said.Afghanistan, of course, is a team that banks heavily on spinners with Rashid Khan leading the line. Mohammed Nabi and Noor Ahmed are the two other spinners who should get the nod. All of them were part of the IPL and they know everything about bowling to the Indian batters.For India, it will be crucial that Virat Kohli , who had an indifferent USA leg with scores of 1,4 and 0, gets into the groove. Opening the batting, it could well be on Kohli to take the attack to the Afghan bowlers, and we might see him playing the slog sweep, a weapon that he has included in his arsenal to deal with the spin.Rathour insists that a ""hungrier"" Kohli, following his slight bad patch in New York, could be even more dangerous. ""I have absolutely no concern about his form. He batted superbly in the IPL and a couple of dismissals here doesn't change anything. Actually, it's good that he is a little hungrier, he is really keen to do well and really switched on,"" Rathour said.That should be music to the ears of all those fans who have been waiting for India to break a decade-long ICC title jinx. The signs so far aren't bad at all.",Team India will hit the nets in Barbados on June 17 to prepare for their game against Afghanistan.

T20 WORLD CUP:

|

MIAMI: These are two guys at two different ends of the spectrum. One's a phenomenal talent who is still lucky to be alive, let alone playing, while the other is an honest trier who keeps fighting.Rishabh Pant and Arshdeep Singh are two completely different personalities, but if you're to closely analyse India's United States leg of the T20 World Cup --they are the two stars who have gone slightly under the radar.Arshdeep, of course, has won a Man of the Match award with a spell of 4/9 against the United States, but Pant's contribution has almost going unnoticed. In all the three games that India won, the wicketkeeper-batter who is playing for India for the first time after his life-threatening injury late in 2022, played crucial knocks. 36 not out, 42 and 18 might not look huge, but if you put it in context, the importance becomes clearer.Pant is batting at No. 3, a position that is always reserved for the crème-de-la-crème of any batting line-up. And in New York, Pant came into bat when India lost the early wicket of Virat Kohli with virtually nothing on the board.The world knows Pant is a dynamite with the bat, but what made it special for him here was he wasn't always at his destructive best. Yet, the southpaw never went below run a ball, in fact his 31-ball 42 against Pakistan was probably the best batting effort on the New York minefield by any batter.Pant's promotion to the No. 3 spot was the product of a brain-wave of captain Rohit Sharma , who seems to have meticulously prepared for this T20 World Cup after the heartbreak of the ODI World Cup in India. ""The moment I saw Pant bat in the IPL, I knew where he would be batting in the World Cup,"" Rohit said in one of his press conferences. The decision was communicated to the wicketkeeper-batter early and the 26-year-old has gone out of his way to justify the captain's faith in him.In New York before the first game, on a practice pitch which everyone was avoiding due to its uneven nature, Pant asked the throwdown expert to test him with vicious short balls from less than 22 yards. Pant was getting hit on the body a few times, but you could see that the lion-hearted cricketer was trying to overcome fear.The team management was also looking to have the left-right combination going through the middle-order, something that Pant's promotion facilitates. In his decision to promote Pant to No. 3, Rohit is in fact looking forward to the West Indies leg as well, where he wants to use the dasher's counter-attacking abilities.""The kind of ability he has, it's always tough to find the right number for Pant. But with three right-handers in the top four, I thought it was nice to have him in the middle. And later on, in West Indies, when spin is going to play a big part, his counterattacking can come into picture in a big way. He has got an all-round game and we want to utilize that upfront, where he gets to play maximum balls along with some of the other experienced players,"" Rohit said.While Pant's batting is crucial to India's success going forward, Arshdeep's ability to swing the new ball and deliver the yorker at the death are equally important. The fact that he is also a left-armer adds the much-needed variety to the pace attack, which has three more right-armers.After doing well against Ireland, Arshdeep was entrusted to bowl the last over against Pakistan, where he did just enough to keep the desperate batters at bay. That was followed by his match-winning effort against USA and in all probability, if the team management decides to go with three specialist pacers in West Indies in the XI, he will be one of them.Arshdeep, though, doesn't want to think that far. ""I remember what (batting coach) Vikram Rathour told us in the team meeting - 'stay where your feet are'. So right now, we just stay in the present and prepare for that.""For now, the Super-8s are ""the present"" and Arshdeep would surely love to be at the top of his game at the Kensington Oval on Thursday.",Rishabh Pant and Arshdeep Singh have gone under the radar at T20 World Cup. Pant has been promoted to No. 3 in India's batting order. Singh has been playing for India for the first time since his life-threatening injury in 2022.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111048115,imgsize-65518,width-400,resizemode-4/111048115.jpg"

However, the pursuit was far from smooth, with Pakistan nearly squandering the opportunity to secure the win.""I think with the bowling, conditions suited our bowlers. But in batting we made few mistakes in the matches against the USA and India.

We lost back-to-back wickets, but got over the line in the end.""Babar acknowledged that Pakistan need to bounce back swiftly from this setback. However, he remained uncertain about his future as the team's skipper, providing no clear indication of his plans.""Let's see, what team needs, I'll be okay with it.

It's tough (the result),"" said Afridi.Ireland captain Paul Stirling admitted that the team struggled to find the optimal combination of players throughout the tournament.""It's getting that balance right.

Even if you had won, you didn't deserve to go ahead. You would've lost in Super Eight stage. You wouldn't have had easier opponents there.

But Sehwag reckons that ICC need to rethink their strategy.""In 2007, neither India nor Pakistan qualified for the second round. We were in different groups back then.

The tournament has seen some surprises, including the defeat of top seed Jessica Pegula, which has opened up the draw significantly.""For me today it was just about trying my best to stay in the present moment. She has a great serve, my focus was just to get the ball back into the court on return,"" Andreescu said after the match.""Staying mentally tough was key today.""The match was punctuated by two lengthy rain breaks, causing both players to struggle with consistency in the early stages.

Osaka made several unforced errors, including a backhand into the net on match point.Osaka has historically not performed her best on grass, with her Grand Slam victories coming on hard courts at the US Open and Australian Open.However, she has shown potential to be a contender at Wimbledon this year as she makes her return after giving birth to her daughter.Osaka recently had a match point against eventual French Open winner Iga Swiatek in the second round, posing one of the toughest challenges for the world number one on the Paris clay.","Former world number one Naomi Osaka loses in three-set thriller to Canadian Bianca Andreescu.

And the India star says he is elated to be nominated to represent India at the Olympics for a third time in his career in Paris later this year.""This one feels really very, very special. Eight years ago I didn't even think I would play for India (at the Olympics) again. I missed Tokyo and I wasn't anywhere close to representing the country,"" Bopanna said on Thursday.The 44-year-old Karnataka lad will be pairing with Tamil Nadu's Sriram Balaji in Paris after the All India Tennis Association went along with Bopanna's choice of partner.Bopanna earned automatic qualification by virtue of his world No. 4 ranking -- the top 10 ranked players in men's and women's doubles are given direct acceptance and can choose a player ranked in the top-300 as their partner.Sumit Nagal, ranked 77 in singles as on Monday -- the ranking cut-off date for Olympics entries, is on the list of alternates.June 14 is the deadline for national federations to submit their nominations to the ITF, which will announce the final list on July 4.The tennis competition will be played at Roland Garros, where Bopanna had won the mixed doubles crown with Canada's Gabriela Dabrowski in 2017.He will be at his best in terms of form and mental space too, despite being the oldest player on the ATP Tour.""I have been playing very good tennis. Got into the top-10 in rankings and qualified for the Games, the only way I could do it. I have been able to do it twice (having done it in 2016 as well), really happy about it,"" he said.The past two editions when he competed in the quadrennial showpiece had been marred by controversies with AITA initially refusing to pair him with the partner of his choice before climbding down due to public backlash.This time, however, the selection committee headed by former Davis Cupper Nandan Bal, who had also nurtured Bopanna in his formative years, had respected his decision to pair with Balaji.""It is really great that AITA has supported me, and it is a very progressive way moving forward,"" the Bengaluru lad said.Looking ahead at the Paris Games, Bopanna said: ""I am feeling extremely positive, I have been playing some great tennis over the last 18 months and enjoying my time on court. And I want to be able to translate that positivity to my partner.""It is going to be a new experience, playing with someone who will be making his debut at the Olympics.""I played Balaji in his last match as well (in the third round of the French Open). He had a good match in Paris. The last time I played with him was in the Davis Cup in Bengaluru (against Uzbekistan in 2017).""Bopanna said that the good thing for Balaji would be that he would be playing the Olympics at a ""familiar"" venue but sought to play down expectations.""Balaji has an explosive game and has all the shots,"" he said before adding, ""Olympics will be a very different scenario. He had nothing to lose and played freely (during the French Open).""It is a great opportunity for him. Thankfully it is going to be at Roland Garros, a place he will be familiar with.""No matter what, they (rival teams) will be coming for him. It is going to be tough.""Bopanna will have his coach Balachandran Manikkath and physiotherapist Rebecca van Orshaegen in his corner at the Games.Balachandran has been a reputed coach in the Indian circuit for many years now. Besides working with Bopanna, he also heads the Bengaluru stalwart's academy located at 'Sport School'.He has also been a part of the Indian Davis Cup team's support staff on a couple of occasions.Currently, Balachandran is also assisting other Indian players who are part of the ""Doubles Dream of India"" programme -- an initiative by Pune-based tech firm KPIT to support top-200 ranked men's doubles players.Van Orshaegen is a 25-year-old Belgian who played tennis largely at the national level before moving onto sports physiotherapy. She started working with Bopanna a little more than a year ago and has played a key role in prolonging his career.""Balu has been working with Balaji too (as part of the 'Doubles Dream of India' project), and knows his game really well. I have seen him (Balachandran) for 25 years, having someone familiar on your side is always a good thing. Rebecca is the most important member of my team. I am 44 now, recovery is a key aspect of my game at this stage.""Bopanna and Balaji will look to play together in a couple of tournaments in the lead up to the Olympics.""We plan to play a couple of tournaments after Wimbledon, maybe Hamburg and Umag. There is really no time (to prepare) before that. Practising on grass for a tournament on clay doesn't make sense.

NEW DELHI: The All India Tennis Association ( AITA ) has officially announced that Rohan Bopanna will team up with N Sriram Balaji to represent India in the men's doubles competition at the upcoming Paris Olympics . This confirmation comes after reports from PTI suggesting that the 44-year-old Bopanna had chosen Balaji as his partner for his final attempt at securing an Olympic medal.

In a press release, AITA expressed their excitement, stating, ""The All India Tennis Association (AITA) is thrilled to announce that Rohan Bopanna and N. Sriram Balaji have qualified for the Paris Olympics 2024 in the tennis doubles event. Their journey to the Olympics marks a significant milestone for Indian tennis.""

The decision was reached during a selection committee meeting, presided over by Nandan Bal, a former Davis Cup Captain. Although Yuki Bhambri, India's second-ranked doubles player, was also considered, AITA sources revealed that Balaji's agility on the court ultimately tipped the scales in his favor.

Balachandran Manikkath, who is affiliated with Bopanna's Sports School in Bengaluru, will accompany the team as their coach, while Rebecca Van Orshaegen will serve as the physiotherapist.
