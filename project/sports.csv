NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Dinesh Karthik has expressed doubts about Bangladesh 's ability to challenge India in the upcoming Test series, despite Bangladesh's recent success in Pakistan. Speaking on India's prospects on Cricbuzz, Karthik emphasized that winning against India on home soil is a significant challenge.""I personally don't think so. I think beating India in India is a humongous task.Bangladesh has played well in Pakistan. But no, I don't think there will be much trouble for India to beat Bangladesh,"" Karthik remarked.Discussing India's squad selection, Karthik highlighted the possibility of including young pacer Harshit Rana. However, he noted that the team already has four established medium pacers.""Could there be a chance for Harshit Rana? I thought he bowled very well, something very special about him. They already have four medium pacers, who are good medium pacers. So, it's a good team,"" Karthik said.Karthik also suggested that India might prepare pace-friendly pitches for the series, which would help against Bangladesh and serve as preparation for the upcoming series against Australia.""I get the feeling India's going to play on slightly pace-oriented pitches, knowing that it's a good way to beat Bangladesh. Also, they will be preparing for theAustralian Test series . I think they will only play with two spinners—Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja—followed by three fast bowlers,"" he explained.Regarding KL Rahul 's role in the team, Karthik praised his improvement as a wicketkeeper but voiced concerns about the physical demands of keeping in Test matches.""KL Rahul is a very good keeper, who has improved a lot. And I don't think it's fair to call him a part-time wicketkeeper anymore,"" Karthik stated. He added, ""Keeping in Test cricket is hard work across five days, and he's had his struggles with injuries. He has a back he needs to take care of in the long run. So, I don't think it's fair to entrust him with the keeping spot. But I genuinely feel he will make it as a batter and do really well this season.""With the series against Bangladesh approaching, Team India appears well-prepared with strong batting and bowling units.",Former Indian cricketer Dinesh Karthik has expressed doubts about Bangladesh's ability to challenge India in the upcoming Test series.

Why the women's field is so weak in Polgar's country,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/why-the-womens-field-is-so-weak-in-polgars-country/articleshow/113307535.cms,"China’s former world champion Hou Yifan, aged 37, is still women’s world No. 1. She is almost inactive but keeps her rating. Her Elo strength (Elo 2633) makes her world No. 107 if we take gender bifurcation out of the window. She is not a part of the China team in the ongoing Olympiad, neither are her three compatriots – reigning world No. 2 Wen Jun, No.3 Tang Zhongyi and No. 4 Lie Tingjie. The ban on Russia and withdrawal of Muzychuk sisters of Ukraine have added to the problem – a weak field.With top-8 rated women missing the Olympiad, about 200 men currently playing in the country of the great Judit Polgar are rated higher than the top woman participant, Nana Dzagnidze of Georgia.Former seven-time national champion Praveen Thipsay, whose wife Bhagyashree Thipsay (nee Sathe) was the women’s Asian champion, said that despite the current boom-time for chess , the gap between men and women players is widening. “I know male players spend more than 12 hours a day on chess,” said Thipsay. “But I don’t know any woman who spends more than seven hours a day on the game.”Koneru Humpy , India’s women’s world No. 6, who has opted out of the Olympiad for family responsibilities, said, “Generally speaking, you can reach your best level during your teenage time. Then it depends on knowledge, ability to work hard and opportunities. You need a lot of time and focus to continuously work on your game. It’s practically difficult for women after a certain age. Women get less time to work on chess because they invariably do the house management. Plus, there are other responsibilities and priorities.”In other words, chess ceases to remain the sole focus of women players after a certain stage in life. And demands of modern chess are excruciating with methods of preparation and activity at an all-time high.Polgar has been critical of strong women players who continue to play in the women’s section. “Women are the greatest enemies of women,” is her oft-mentioned quote.Does 37-year-old Humpy regret her decision of playing only in the women’s section?Humpy, who will be a part of Mumba Masters in the Global Chess League starting in London from Oct 3, said, “The women’s Grand Prix started in 2009. I decreased my participation in the Open section around that time. I regret that a lot. But it doesn’t make much of a difference now. I play the game for enjoyment, to stay in touch with the sport. I am not as competitive as I was in my teenage years.”The top-10 women players are born between 1987 and 1994 (aged 30 to 37). The corresponding figure for men is 1987 and 2006 (aged 18 to 37).Thipsay pointed out that it’s easy for elite-level women players to maintain their consistency. “They can sustain their class because they have improved in the human style of the sport. The teenage boys’ improvement is by way of Artificial Intelligence (faster progress largely aided by computer preparation).”Former women’s classical and rapid world champion Alexandra Kosteniuk has managed to get an entry in the Chess Olympiad despite FIDE banning Russian teams for the invasion of Ukraine.It was made possible because the 40-year-old grandmaster (Elo 2483) is representing Switzerland on the top board. Kosteniuk has dual citizen -ship. She first married a Swiss businessman – almost 25 years older to her –as an 18-year-old to. Now, she is married to a Russian GM who is 12 years older.","Former world champion Hou Yifan, aged 37, is still women’s world No. 1.

Moin Khan blasts Ramiz Raja for 'demoralising' son Azam Khan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/moin-khan-blasts-ramiz-raja-for-demoralising-son-azam-khan/articleshow/113296635.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan batter Azam Khan first gained attention in the Pakistan Super League (PSL), where he showcased his ability to turn games around with his powerful shots.Despite his impressive skills, Azam faced scrutiny in the early stages of his career due to concerns about his fitness levels. This issue has also been a significant factor in his exclusion from the national team. Moin Khan , a former wicketkeeper-batter for Pakistan and the father of Azam, has spoken out against Ramiz Raja , the ex-chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ).Moin holds Ramiz responsible for hindering his son's progress in cricket, specifically pointing to the contentious decision to exclude Azam from the squad prior to the T20 World Cup in 2021.""In the 2022 (2021) World Cup, Azam was also selected for the team, but Ramiz Raja dropped him. At that time, if the chief selector had made a wrong selection, he should have been removed, but they didn't have the courage, and as a result, they demoralized a young player. In this World Cup as well, you can see how he played,"" Moin told Cricket Pakistan.Moin also expressed his disapproval regarding the choice to drop Azam from the squad after a single game. The promising wicketkeeper-batsman failed to score in the match against USA, which resulted in Pakistan's unexpected loss.""I watched the entire World Cup and the matches leading up to it, and it seemed like Azam was the number one choice for wicketkeeping and batting. Then suddenly, after just one match, the entire strategy was changed. Azam wasn't given a chance to keep wickets after one match and was dropped after getting out on the very first ball,"" he said .However, Moin emphasized that Azam needs to become ""physically and mentally"" stronger to maintain his performance at the highest level.""I'm not saying that all the blame lies with the team management and the captain; Azam has his own shortcomings too. He needs to make himself physically and mentally stronger, follow the fitness routines of other sportsmen. For the past month or so, I've noticed he's been working hard to improve his fitness with his trainer Shehzar Mohammad, even taking him along to the Caribbean League,"" said Moin.","Moin Khan has spoken out against Ramiz Raja, the ex-chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board.

Michael Holding: The legend behind 'Whispering Death',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/michael-holding-the-legend-behind-whispering-death/articleshow/113296275.cms,"NEW DELHI: Michael Holding , one of the most feared and respected fast bowlers in cricket history, earned the iconic nickname ' Whispering Death ' during his playing days.It wasn’t just Holding’s blistering pace that sent shivers down the spines of batsmen; it was his almost silent, effortless approach to the bowling crease that gave him this eerie moniker.Holding's run-up was a thing of beauty — smooth, rhythmic, and silent.As he glided across the pitch while bowling, with barely a sound, his rapid approach often caught umpires and batsmen off guard.Umpires, especially the renowned Dickie Bird, frequently remarked that they couldn't hear Holding's footsteps as he charged in to bowl.The silent approach combined with the sheer speed and accuracy of his deliveries led to the nickname 'Whispering Death', a fitting description for a bowler who could destroy batting line-ups in an instant.Known for his fearsome bowling during the era of the legendary West Indian pace attack, Holding wreaked havoc on cricketing teams worldwide.His most famous spell came during a Test match against England in 1976 at The Oval, where he produced a devastating performance, taking 14 wickets, including a breathtaking sequence of fast-bowling mastery.His natural athleticism and ability to generate ferocious pace from a seemingly relaxed run-up made him a unique and dangerous force on the field.Off the field, however, Holding was the complete opposite of the terror he unleashed with the ball.Known for his calm and composed demeanor, he later transitioned into a respected cricket commentator, where his deep knowledge of the game and measured commentary earned him praise across the world.The legend of 'Whispering Death' remains a powerful symbol of Holding’s legacy — a bowler whose grace and ferocity came together to make him one of cricket's all-time greats.","Michael Holding was one of the most feared and respected fast bowlers in cricket history.

For the club representing the seven northeastern states in India’s top-division football is about to kick off ISL season 11 not on the back of the disappointment that had earlier engulfed the club.They are the Durand Cup champions, scripting a remarkable triumph over giants Mohun Bagan Super Giant in the summit clash, who expect nothing but the best-ever ISL performance and trump the playoffs finishes that had been their best finish so far.However, head coach Juan Pedro Benali does not want his wards to think too much into the future in their quest for the best ISL show.“You’ve got to understand that now the teams that are waiting for us are tougher. They’ll be difficult because before they were saying, ‘we are playing the NorthEast (NEUFC)’ but now they say, ‘NorthEast are coming for us’. They’ll be warned about us. So some games are going to be very good, and some games are going to be very bad. So we’ll wait and see,” Benali said during the media day interactions.“The important thing for us is not to look away. We need to just focus on the coming game. We will finish this one with success and then think of the next away game. If we start thinking too far ahead of us, like winning the Championship or winning the Shield, then we fail. We just need to think about the opening game and nothing else.”And the Spanish coach, with experience of working in four continents, acknowledges the NEUFC setup as the ideal atmosphere that helps its players thrive and go for their goals as a team.“In NEUFC, we are a family comprising the players and staff in the dressing room, those in the office as well as the medics and staff on the field. We are a small but well-knit family. There’s Mandar (Tamhane) looking after all the big and small things. And John Abraham is always aware of everything about the team. That’s why our dressing room is always calm. There’s responsibility, but we can take them on with a fresh mind,” Benali opined.Meanwhile, Mandar Tamhane – the NEUFC CEO with experience of working with Bengaluru FC – spoke of the vision that guides the team forward.“This victory came after 10 long years. So it’s a very proud moment for us. But it’s just a small step and there’s a long way to go for us. The Durand victory has put us on the right track and in a positive mindset. As a club, I think we should win the Championship or the Shield or the Super Cup,” Tamhane explained.Now, it’s time for them to carry forward the momentum from the Durand Cup win and the hopes of seven states in the ISL.","NorthEast United FC will kick off ISL season 11 against Mohammedan Sporting.

This information was confirmed by the league on Thursday.Mbappé requested the commission's intervention regarding three months of unpaid salary and a portion of a loyalty bonus after moving to Real Madrid on a free transfer this summer.Talks between PSG officials and Mbappé's representatives occurred in Paris on Wednesday, but Mbappé declined a mediation offer.Following the meeting, Mbappé's representatives told AP that the France striker had asked the commission to take note of the non-payment of three months' salary and the last third of a loyalty bonus.PSG has stated they do not intend to pay the amount and will pursue further legal action.""In light of the limitations of the commission's legal scope to take a complete decision on this matter, the matter must now be contested in another legal forum, to which Paris Saint-Germain is delighted to present all the facts over the coming months and year,"" the club said in a message to the AP.PSG has asserted that it is not obligated to pay the World Cup-winning player under a contract signed when Mbappé was excluded from the squad prior to the 2023-24 season. This exclusion occurred after the player chose not to extend his contract with the club.""As a matter of law and fact, the player has made clear, repeated public and private commitments that must be respected, having been afforded unprecedented benefits by the club over seven years in Paris,"" PSG said after the league's announcement. ""And the club looks forward to these being upheld in the proper forum, if the player seeks to pursue this incomprehensibly reputationally damaging matter further, in due course.""Mbappé's relationship with Paris Saint-Germain ended with significant tension in his final season at the club.PSG felt disappointed after offering Mbappé their most lucrative contract in 2022.

Mbappé was reportedly upset by this because the contract was until 2024, with an option for an additional year.In June last year, Mbappé surprised PSG by informing them he would not exercise the option for an extra year. With his contract effectively ending in a year, PSG faced the possibility of having to sell Mbappé to avoid losing him for free when the contract expired.The situation escalated in the summer of 2023. After Mbappé confirmed he would not extend his contract, PSG omitted him from a preseason tour to Japan and South Korea and had him train with fringe players. PSG stated they would prefer to sell him rather than let him leave for free in 2024. However, Mbappé rejected a 300 million euro offer from Saudi team Al-Hilal.PSG initially left Mbappé out of the team's opening league game of that season.

NEW DELHI: In September 2020, Manchester United pulled off one of the most dramatic Premier League wins with a 3-2 victory over Brighton at the Amex Stadium.Referee Chris Kavanagh initially ended the match, but moments later, VAR intervened, prompting one of the strangest conclusions to a game in recent memory.The controversy began when Harry Maguire ’s header struck Neal Maupay 's outstretched arm in the box.Referee Kavanagh, having already blown the final whistle, was advised by VAR to review the incident.After consulting the pitchside monitor, Kavanagh overturned his initial decision and awarded Manchester United a penalty.In the 100th minute, Bruno Fernandes stepped up to the spot and coolly slotted the ball into the top-right corner, securing United’s 3-2 win.It was the last kick of the game, as the International Football Association Board (IFAB) rules allow the extension of time for penalty kicks even after the whistle had been blown.If Brighton’s goalkeeper had saved the shot, any rebound attempt wouldn’t have counted.The chaotic finale overshadowed a thrilling match in which Brighton had struck the woodwork five times and thought they had secured a point when Solly March equalized deep into added time. However, the late penalty snatched the result away, leaving Brighton and their manager Graham Potter bitterly disappointed.Potter lamented, “I don't know where the extra time came from to be honest. We are bitterly disappointed to concede the way we have; at the time we have.”The game is remembered as one of the most extraordinary uses of VAR, illustrating the fine margins and dramatic turns football can take, even after the final whistle.","In September 2020, Manchester United pulled off one of the most dramatic Premier League wins with a 3-2 victory over Brighton at the Amex Stadium.

He's been the best dad, actually. So I'm pretty, really proud of him, and he has a really special place in my heart.""On the tennis front, there's no comparison between the father and the son.Borg senior, 68 now, lifted Sweden to its maiden Davis Cup win in 1975 when he was just 19. If his 33 singles win streak is a record in the tournament history, his six French Open trophies - four of them in a row - an five straight Wimbledon wins put him altogether in a different plane.Anyone else, in any walk of life, would have walked away from that borrowed stardom and harsh scrutiny that comes with it. Borg the junior has decided to not only play the sport, but also excel in it.Currently ranked 603, Leo had risen to 334 in the ATP charts last year before suffering a loss of form. He has recovered some of his level and motivation with a title and runner-up finish in the dreary ITF circuit in Thailand in recent weeks, jumping 169 places in the ranking ladder.Leo, 21, put it down to a ""simple"" advice he received from his father long ago.""Since I was really young, he said, ‘it's really simple, never stop fighting until the last point'. And that's been a very good advice, just to fight the whole match and the life outside tennis also. That's a really simple thing, but it's been really big.""Amazingly, Leo has not watched videos of his father playing.""I have watched some things, of course, but it's true, I have never searched a video of him or anything like that. Yeah, (it) is funny, I know,"" he smiled.The youngster's humble journey on the tennis court may also explain the current woes of the sport in Sweden. For, Sweden is not just the land of Borg, it is also home to Zlatan.While Leo, who dabbled in football till the age of 12, had no doubts about his commitment to the racquet sport, his compatriots have quickly gravitated to soccer and other more rewarding sports. Not in them the mettle to fight back from losing the fourth set 16-18 in a tiebreaker after having five match points, and go on to win the fifth set in a grand slam final.""In my dad's time, they had a really good amount of tennis players. I think they had some time like five top-10 players. Now, it's completely different. We don't have so many players in Sweden, it's a little bit sad because we are a really good tennis country. I think your mentality is not that good anymore,"" Leo said.""Many Swedish players quit tennis around the age of 18-19 because they think it's too hard to get through pros. Of course, it's hard, you really have to fight through to get to the top. I think out mentality has to be better.""I think we have become too comfort (sic) in our country, to get to the top. So I think we have to focus on the mental side a little bit. Yeah, that's the most important thing, I think, or the difference, from his time.""Tennis is not that big anymore in Sweden, it's not a strange thing, actually, unfortunately.""",Leo Borg is the son of tennis legend Bjorn Borg.

Despite having never defeated Sweden in Davis Cup history, the Indian team is hopeful about securing their first victory in their sixth matchup.The contest will take place on a medium-speed indoor court at the Royal Tennis Hall in Sweden. India usually prefers faster surfaces, which would better suit their big servers.Indoor courts typically feature quick ball travel and are unaffected by external factors like wind.The team will play without top players Sumit Nagal and Yuki Bhambri .Former national champion Siddharth Vishwakarma is under consideration to join the team for an upcoming critical match. Despite his skills, his lack of experience at this level might prevent him from playing in a live rubber.The decision will likely consider his potential and the high-pressure nature of the match. His future participation seems contingent on further growth and experience.Captain Rohit Rajpal may opt for doubles specialist Balaji for the singles as he did against Pakistan on grass court earlier this year. In that match, Balaji performed well by defeating veteran Aqeel Khan in Islamabad and is currently in good form in Stockholm.Ramkumar Ramanathan is set to play a key role on the opening day of the upcoming match. The team's decision on the second singles match is still pending, with the choice between Niki Poonacha and N Sriram Balaji.Poonacha, despite his talent, has uncertain fitness due to a recent ankle sprain during practice. He is more focused on doubles and, although he beat Nagal earlier this year in Pune, has not played or won much in singles recently.Elias Ymer, Sweden's top singles player, is currently ranked 238. Indian player Ramkumar has faced Ymer twice on the ATP Tour, securing victories on both occasions.Ramkumar's performance has consistently shown strong talent and skill, yet the key for him is to stay composed under pressure and trust in his abilities.On Sunday, Balaji is set to play doubles. His partner will be either Ramkumar or Poonacha, which will be decided based on the scores after the first day.""We have better servers, and our players like to get in, play shorter points but these are medium-speed courts, so we are getting used to it by playing a lot of singles with each other,"" Rajpal told PTI.""If Yuki and Sumit were here, the tie would have tilted towards us, now it's 50-50.""""Leo Borg (second singles player) has improved a lot, we are watching him. They have a tough doubles team.""In preparation for the upcoming match, India's newly appointed Davis Cup coach, Ashutosh Singh, has conducted thorough research upon his arrival in Stockholm.In preparation for the upcoming competition, Ashutosh engaged with the coaches of the new team members, including Aryan Shah, to understand the young players' mindset and playing style.The Swedish team, led by Borg, holds the 603rd position in the rankings. Their doubles players, Andre Goransson and Filip Bergevi, are formidable competitors, ranked 66 and 125 respectively.Ashutosh engaged in discussions with players who have previously faced Borg to gather valuable insights. Additionally, Ashutosh dedicated a significant amount of time to analysing videos of the opposing players, which will aid in formulating effective strategies.The draw for the event is set to occur on Friday. The first day will feature singles matches, with doubles and reverse singles scheduled for Sunday.The winner of this tie will advance to the Qualifiers next year, while the losing team will move to the World Group I play-offs.","India will play Sweden in the Davis Cup World Group I contest starting on September 14.

Niki Poonacha fell on the centre court, he sprained his ankle.The physios are working with him, he seems to be doing ok,"" captain Rohit Rajpal said from Stockholm on Wednesday. ""There was a spot on the centre court where his shoes got stuck and he fell. We taped it (the ankle), just to protect it.""It happened two days ago.

Taylor Fritz

to become 1st Italian man to win US Open

He's 6 ft 3' with a scraggy crown, a face that doesn't say much and legs that are defined to cover great ground, run miles and miles at the speed of lightning. Then there is the intangible. An alloy of the unbendable ilk that runs through Jannik Sinner .The scrutiny the top-seed faced coming into the US Open is hard to imagine. He was fighting questions on his integrity - including some damning ones raised by fellow pros - following two positive tests in March for the banned steroid Clostebol.The 23-year-old was cleared of fault or negligence by an independent tribunal in the week before the season's final Grand Slam, but the court of public opinion, revved up by the engines of social discourse, had turned the glare on him.

At best it was a divided locker room.So, when Sinner threw up his arms up at the end of a power-packed slugfest with American Taylor Fritz, where he had rallied from 3-5 in the third set, reeling off four straight games to seal a dominant win, he stood tall in the winner's circle that isn't for the weak hearted.

""I felt like I had grown, match by match and that my confidence level went higher and higher (with each match). I'm happy how I handled this one.""Sinner, who surrounded himself with a slim-look team in New York, after dropping physio and fitness coach Giacomo Naldi and Umberto Ferrara from his close circle, had his two coaches - Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi - and girlfriend Anna Kalinskaya , ranked 14 on the WTA Tour, to fall back on.""The people who are close to me daily, people who know me already from when I was very young, my family, my team and everyone who supports me,"" Sinner said of the people who stood by him in the hardest times of his young career. ""I always try to stick with them, especially when the moments are getting difficult and tough, because I know that they can help me in these moments.""Sinner, whose title run in New York has taken his record for the year to 55-5, and extended his winning streak to 11 matches, said he's still sometimes weighed down by the incidents of the last five months.""It was and it's still a little bit in my mind,"" he said. ""My team and people who are close to me, they know what I've been through in the last months. It was not only one week before the tournament. It was months.

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner ’s 2024 US Open triumph on Sunday marked a major milestone in his tennis career, as he claimed his second Grand Slam title of the year.The 22-year-old Italian defeated Taylor Fritz in a straight-set victory, 6-3, 6-4, 7-5, ending a 21-year wait for an American male champion at the majors.Sinner’s historic win also made him the first Italian man to conquer the US Open, following his Australian Open success earlier in the year.Sinner’s rise in tennis is as unique as it is inspiring. However, before he was known for his powerful forehands and quick reflexes on the court, he was flying down the slopes of the Italian Alps .Growing up in the mountainous South Tyrol region, Sinner was a highly skilled skier, excelling in both slalom and giant slalom.His early years were spent mastering the art of skiing, competing in national junior events, and often securing first place in numerous competitions within his age category, where his balance and precision were key to his success.Skiing also instilled in him a strong mental focus, something that would later become an asset in his tennis career.At the age of 13, Sinner made a pivotal decision—choosing tennis over skiing. He relocated across Italy to train under the guidance of renowned coach Riccardo Piatti , in what proved to be a game-changing move.Piatti quickly recognized Sinner’s proactive, aggressive style, which stood out for someone so young. ""He hit the ball fast, always aiming to win the points,"" Piatti once remarked, noting that Sinner’s fearless mindset was a trait not commonly seen in junior players.Sinner himself credits his skiing background for shaping his mental approach to tennis. Just as in skiing, where each race lasts mere seconds and requires total focus, tennis demanded the same kind of short bursts of concentration.""In both skiing and tennis, he knows when to focus and when to relax,"" Piatti explained, drawing parallels between the two sports that have shaped Sinner’s rise.From being ranked 870th just two years ago to reaching the world number one spot in 2024, Sinner’s ascent has been meteoric. His calm under pressure and relentless drive to improve have made him a formidable force on the court.","Jannik Sinner is the first Italian man to win the US Open. The 22-year-old defeated Taylor Fritz 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 on Sunday. It was Sinner's second Grand Slam title of the year. He was ranked 870th just two years ago.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113192876,imgsize-82438,width-400,resizemode-4/113192876.jpg"
