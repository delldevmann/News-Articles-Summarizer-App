India vs Pakistan in Hockey: What is the head-to-head record and why India are favourites for the Asian Champions Trophy 2024 match,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/hockey/top-stories/india-vs-pakistan-in-hockey-what-is-the-head-to-head-record-and-why-india-are-favourites-for-the-asian-champions-trophy-2024-match/articleshow/113339280.cms,"HEAD TO HEAD RECORD

India and Pakistan have a storied traditional rivalry when it comes to hockey , right from the post-division days when the teams from the two countries contested three Olympic finals and one World Cup final. Another leaf will be added to the history pages of this rivalry when the two teams meet in their last league match of the Asian Champions Trophy (ACT) in Moqi, China, on Saturday.Both the teams are unbeaten in the tournament so far, but that won't be the correct reflection on their respective form.Defending champions India have won all their four matches, while Pakistan have won two and drawn two to stand behind the India team at No. 2 on the points table.As a result of that, both have already secured a place in the semifinals, while the remaining two spots will be contested between South Korea, Malaysia and hosts China. Japan have been eliminated from the race to the semis.While India and Pakistan contests until the 2014 Asian Games final were mostly fought on a knife's edge, the wins column is heavily loaded in favour of India since then.That point reflects in the fact that Pakistan's last win against India came in 2016 and in the last 16 matches between the two teams, India have won 14 times, while the other two were draws.During the Asian Games in Hangzhou last year, which was the last meeting between the two teams, India secured a resounding 10-2 victory in their pool match.Overall, however, the head-to-head stats are still in favour of Pakistan, but those numbers don't draw the right picture for the hockey fans, as the sport has plunged to a new low in Pakistan, while India have reclaimed their lost spot on the Olympic podium with two consecutive bronze medals in the last two edition of the Games in Paris and Tokyo.Played: 180India won: 66Pakistan won: 82Drawn: 32India's dominance in the ACT is unparalleled, with four titles to their name. They emerged victorious in the final against Malaysia last year in Chennai.Pakistan, with three ACT titles, stand as the second most successful team in the tournament's history.","India and Pakistan meet in their last league match of the Asian Champions Trophy (ACT) in Moqi, China, on Saturday.

Captain Dhoni, known for his calm and composed demeanor, displayed visible frustration after this unexpected loss.Badrinath recounted, ""In this match against RCB in Chennai, we were chasing 110 odd runs.We lost wickets in a hurry and we ended up losing the match.

Asian Champions Trophy: India vs Pakistan rivalry returns on the hockey turf,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/hockey/top-stories/asian-champions-trophy-india-favourites-against-unpredictable-pakistan/articleshow/113339670.cms,"A team struggling to find its way back into international hockey against the Olympic bronze medallists is a contest between unequals. But as Pakistan chief coach Tahir Zaman put it, “An India-Pakistan match is always a game of nerves.”With the downslide of Pakistan hockey, much of their storied rivalry with India has been watered down. But that has hardly dulled the intensity with which the teams play against each other.However, the potency of the contest apart, the gap between the two teams is glaring. And not merely in terms of world ranking or recent results, but in fitness, mental strength, and tactics too, India are head and shoulder above Pakistan.With the two teams set to clash in the Asian Champions Trophy in Hulunbir, China on Saturday, India will go into the match as overwhelming favourite. The defending champions are currently on a four-match winning streak and Pakistan have fared well too. India top the six-team single pool with 12 points, while Pakistan are placed second with two wins and an equal number of draws earning them eight points.After being held in their first two matches against Malaysia and Korea, Pakistan edged past Japan 2-1 before taking hosts China in their stride with a 5-1 scoreline.Zaman terms his players ‘unpredictable’ and it’s a fact that is not lost on the Indians.“Past results will not matter when we take on a team like Pakistan. They are a tough side and have the potential to bounce back at any stage in the game. We will look forward to a good match,” stated Indian skipperThe Pakistan team is a blend of youth and experience. While skipper Ammad Butt weighs in with experience, the young strikeforce of Ahmad Nadeem and Hannan Shahid can prove to be a handful for the Indian defenders. One player who will be watched is Sufyan Khan, a 20-year-old drag-flicker, who will look to prove himself after Pakistan’s low success rate in penalty corner conversions in the tournament thus far.On the eve of the match, Butt said, “India have played like true favourites in the tournament so far. But we will take heart from the matches we have played. We have improved in every game and have played disciplined hockey.”On the other hand, India, having rested a few from the Olympic team, have given youngsters a chance. Striker Gurjot Singh, who was handed a debut against China has given a good account of himself along with other youngsters like Araijeet Singh Hundal, Uttam Singh, and Mohd Raheel.The strike duo of Sukhjeet Singh and Abhishek has continued with the good form since Paris. The coordination of the youngsters in the frontline has been heartening and promising.","India take on Pakistan in the Asian Champions Trophy in Hulunbir, China.

The Afghanistan-New Zealand one-off Test being called off without a ball being bowled was the eighth occasion when a Test has been abandoned in such a manner in the history of the game. Before this, seven matches were abandoned without a ball being bowled, dating back to 1890. The last time it happened was almost 26 years ago, in 1998. Let’s take a look at the turn of events...It was the third and final Test of the series with England having won the first two.WG Grace led the English side, while Billy Murdoch captained Australia. It rained for three days, and the match had to be called off without the toss taking place.The third of a five-match Ashes series with Manchester being the venue of the abandonment once again. England was led by Wally Hammond, while Don Bradman was Australia’s skipper. The series was drawn 1-1, but the third Test had to be called off due to continuous rain and soggy outfield. The toss didn’t take place.It was the third Test of a seven-match series, which England won 2-0. The match was abandoned on the third day. England skipper Ray Illingworth had chosen to bowl after winning the toss. But just when the teams were entering the field, it began to rain, and it did so for three straight days in Melbourne. Bill Lawry was Australia’s captain. After the abandonment, a 60-over per side game was organised on the scheduled fifth day which Australia won by 5 wickets. This match gained the status of the first-ever One-Day International.The first of Dunedin’s two called off matches. It was the first of a three-match series which was drawn 0-0 in the end. John Wright was New Zealand’s captain, while Imran Khan was Pakistan’s. It rained incessantly on the first two days and the match was abandoned on Day 3 without a ball being bowled. Later, a One-Day International was played on the scheduled fourth day which New Zealand won by 8 wickets.The second of a four-match Test series, which West Indies eventually won 2-1. Viv Richards was the captain of the West Indies, while Graham Good led England. It rained continuously for the first three days and the match was consequently called off. An ODI was played on the scheduled fifth day which West Indies won by 7 wickets.It was the third Test of a three-match series, which, surprisingly, Zimbabwe won 1-0 after their 7-wicket win in the first Test in Peshawar. The second Test in Lahore was a drawn affair. The match was scheduled from Dec 17-21, and thick fog had engulfed Faisalabad. Unlike rain playing spoilsport in earlier abandoned Tests, this time it was heavy fog that had reduced visibility so much that the match had to be called off on the fourth day. The series had Aamer Sohail as Pakistan’s captain and Alistair Campbell was Zimbabwe’s.It was the first of a three-match Test series which New Zealand eventually won 1-0. Mohammad Azharuddin led India, while New Zealand was captained by Stephen Fleming. It continued to rain into the third day, prompting the match officials to call off the Test on the third day itself. An unofficial one-dayer was played on the scheduled fourth day. Interestingly, the sixth and seventh abandoned Tests were called off on the same day – Dec 20, 1998.","The Afghanistan-New Zealand one-off Test was called off without a ball being bowled.

Closed-door camp in Chennai before first Test against Bangladesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/bangladesh-in-india/closed-door-camp-in-chennai-before-first-test-against-bangladesh/articleshow/113339035.cms,"CHENNAI: It’s a new era in Indian cricket and along with it comes new trappings. Gautam Gambhir , the new head coach of the team, had a brief stint with some of the players in Sri Lanka but that was merely an appetizer. Now comes the main course — a Test series at home against Bangladesh starting in five days’ time. And ‘Gauti’, with his trusted backroom staff of Morne Morkel (bowling coach), Abhishek Nayar (assistant coach) and Ryan ten Doeschate (fielding coach), got down to work with India’s seniors under extreme secrecy at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, the venue of the first Test.No media was allowed. Nothing could be filmed or watched. One had to bank on droplets of information filtering out of ‘Castle Chepauk’ on Friday. Gambhir wanted the entire group together right from the first day, barring Sarfaraz Khan who is playing in the Duleep Trophy. So, Virat Kohli flew in from England late on Thursday night and was among the first to go out on Friday morning and bat against Jasprit Bumrah , R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja Day One of training was a long session and all the top-order batters got about 30-45 minutes of batting. The idea, quite clearly, was to get back into game mode after a long vacation which started after the T20 World Cup win in West Indies on June 29 and carried on following a brief Lanka series in early August.Bangladesh, first up at home after a long holiday, are a bit like an unseeded opponent in the first round of a Grand Slam. With a place in the World Test Championship Final in June 2025 up for grabs, the challenge gradually gets tougher in this cycle of 10 Tests over the next five months.After the first two against Bangladesh, who beat Pakistan recently, it’s a three-Test series at home against New Zealand followed by five against potential WTC Final opponent Australia in their own backyard. As per rough calculations, India need four wins and a draw from these 10 games to qualify for the WTC Final and Gambhir wants to finish the job before the group tours Down Under. For the first cycle of five home Tests, Gambhir doesn’t have to worry too much about the playing XI, but instead about the rotation of his pace bowlers. Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj are likely to play at Chepauk while Mohammed Shami is on a comeback trail.Once Shami is ready, Bumrah could be given a break. In all probability, these three will play three games each before the Australia tour while left-arm pacer Yash Dayal can expect a debut sooner rather than later, if he impresses Morkel and Co. with his swing in practice. Bengal’s Akash Deep, too, is in the mix and he, too, should be tested somewhere down the line before taking a final call for Australia.Another decision that the new coaching staff has to take is whether to go with KL Rahul or Sarfaraz as the No. 5 batter. While Sarfaraz was a success for India when they played England at home a few months ago, Rahul’s class is undeniable. Moreover, Australia are just round the corner and the Karnataka man’s sound technique against shortpitched stuff should be something that the team management will keep in mind. The fact that Rahul can be used as an opener adds to his chances, while the occasional wicketkeeping is a bonus as well.There is another area of interest — the wicketkeeper’s slot. Rishabh Pant, by far, is the best in world cricket at the moment but one has to keep in mind that it has only been a few months since his return to top-flight cricket after a life-threatening accident. Whether Pant’s body is completely ready for the wear and tear of five-day cricket is something that the management has to take a call on.The fact that Dhruv Jurel, who had an extremely impressive debut series against England, is the back-up, will leave Gambhir spoilt for choice. Gauti, though, is known to be a tough taskmaster and he isn’t one who goes by reputation. Even if there’s no question about Rohit Sharma , Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and R Ashwin for the first Test, it’s important that they all hit the ground running.Gambhir will have his own ideas and it’s up to players to execute so that Indian cricket stays on in the cruise mode of the latter part of the Rahul Dravid era.",New head coach Gautam Gambhir had a brief stint with some of the players in Sri Lanka but that was merely an appetizer. Now comes the main course — a Test series at home against Bangladesh starting in five days’ time. The challenge gradually gets tougher in this cycle of 10 Tests over the next five months.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113339033,imgsize-58862,width-400,resizemode-4/113339033.jpg"

Sunil Gavaskar slams Michael Vaughan on 'Joe Root surpassing Sachin Tendulkar' comment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/sunil-gavaskar-slams-michael-vaughan-on-joe-root-surpassing-sachin-tendulkar-comment/articleshow/113287617.cms,"NEW DELHI: Citing recent remarks regarding the prospect of Joe Root overtaking Sachin Tendulkar as the top run-scorer in men's Test cricket, legendary opener Sunil Gavaskar stated that the aggressive response to India's attacks must be given.It is only a matter of time till Root emerges as the top run-getter in Test matches, former England captain Michael Vaughan had said on an episode of the Club Prairie Fire podcast.In addition, he stated that the BCCI would use every resource at its disposal to guarantee that an Indian batter maintains the record.""I can say with experience of more than 50 years that it's not just the Indian crowds who are silent when their team is not doing well but crowds in every country. If there is some noise when, say, India is doing well overseas, it's because of the number of Indian supporters who travel long distances from India and who cheer for them and not the locals.""So next time, when some commentator or media person from overseas tries to talk about the silence of the Indian crowd when India is not doing well, we should ask them why their supporters haven't come to cheer for their team. This business of India bashing has to be countered with aggression because that's the only language they understand.""Recently, I heard someone saying it would be good for Test cricket if Joe Root overtook Sachin Tendulkar's record for most runs and centuries in Test match cricket. Please tell us what's wrong with Test cricket presently when Tendulkar is owning the record and how will Test cricket be better if (and that's a huge if) an Englishman goes on to hold it. In what way will it be better? Kindly enlighten us,"" wrote Gavaskar in his column for Sportstar on Thursday as per IANS.He was taken aback by the statement that the BCCI dislikes Test cricket, even though India plays a lot of red-ball cricket each year. ""For some strange reason, there's a perception overseas that BCCI does not like Test cricket.""That's a ridiculous notion, as India play more than half a dozen Test matches every season, be it at home or away. Just because the IPL is massively successful doesn't mean BCCI is not interested in promoting Test cricket, but that's the narrative that's being peddled by the overseas media.""Gavaskar concluded by advising everyone to keep an eye on whether Lord's will still serve as the location for the World Test Championship final in 2025. ""The ICC just announced that the WTC final will be played at Lord's next June. Well, we have heard the same declaration twice earlier, but as soon as it's seen that England is not going to qualify for the final, the venue gets changed to Southampton or The Oval in London.""Now that England is winning more Test matches in this period and there's a good chance that they may get to the final, we are being told the final will be at Lord's. Let's wait and see. As the old Indian saying goes, DILLI (Lord's) abhi bhi door hai.""","Sunil Gavaskar says aggressive response to India's attacks must be given.

"Coaches Jonathon Trott, Gary Stead react after abandonment, say drainage system of a Test venue 'shouldn't be taken for granted’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/coaches-jonathon-trott-gary-stead-react-after-abandonment-say-drainage-system-of-a-test-venue-shouldnt-be-taken-for-granted/articleshow/113339125.cms,"GREATER NOIDA: As the one-off Test between Afghanistan and New Zealand was called off without a ball being bowled – and not even the toss taking place – there were some stern words from the head coaches Jonathon Trott (Afghanistan) and Gary Stead (New Zealand) at the “post-abandonment” press conference on Friday.A combination of inclement weather, sub-par drainage, lack of trained and adequate ground staff, and insufficient equipment to handle contingency situations led to the two teams mostly spending time at their respective hotels during the duration of the Test.The first two days, however, saw bright sunshine throughout at the Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathik Sports Complex , but play was called off on both days on account of a “wet outfield and damp patches in the playing area”.Both coaches were “disappointed and frustrated” at not getting any play out of the Test with Trott also stating that Afghan players were “heartbroken”.“We are disappointed. We had geared ourselves up, and we had trained really well (for the Test),” Trott said about not getting any play despite bright sunshine on the first two days. “We were very excited to play against New Zealand and put ourselves up against the challenge. We had played warm-up matches and got ourselves accustomed to the conditions. The thing was we got to train on the square on the days before (the Test), so we even got to see the pitch. Our appetite for this particular game was growing as it neared. So, not being able to play even one day is heartbreaking.”Stead echoed Trott’s sentiments. New Zealand wanted to get much-needed match practice ahead of their five World Test Championship (WTC) matches against Sri Lanka (2) and India (3), but that didn’t materialise.“The most frustrating part for us is that we lost the opportunity to be match-hardened and match-ready when we go into our Test match against Sri Lanka next week,” Stead said. “The guys are really disappointed. It was an opportunity to play Afghanistan. It doesn’t come around that often. They have some unique bowlers and it’s always good to get your head around how you face them. The way they play is a little bit different from other countries. It’s always learning what you can do when you get in those match situations.”Although in few words, Trott expressed his displeasure over the drainage system of the Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathik Sports Complex.“I hope it is a good learning case (for organisers) that situations can crop up... everything has got to be checked out and made sure that it’s ready for Test match cricket. After all, it is Test cricket at the end of the day. And I think sometimes we take it for granted when we go and play. Things have already been done in the past for other nations or other venues – with regards to drainage or ground staff and all those sorts of things,” Trott said.The former England top-order batsman also rued about the continuous downpour that the city has experienced in the last 10 days.“To try and play a Test match at this time of the year is always tricky. The amount of water that’s come down is unprecedented for this time of the year or the last three days. But it would have been nice to play some cricket for sure,” Trott said.Although the one-off Test wasn’t a part of the WTC, Black Caps coach Stead said the format is “very, very dear to the team’s hearts” and that’s why not getting any play was quite “disheartening”.“We came here to play cricket and play a Test match. Test cricket, certainly to our group of players, is very, very dear to our hearts and every Test you get to play in is a big one. So regardless of whether it has World Test Championship points or not, it was an opportunity to get out there for five days. The surface looked great.

He suggested that players should focus on performing their basic tasks correctly to avoid mistakes.Reports emerged last week about Babar Azam potentially losing his role as captain of Pakistan's white-ball cricket team. According to sources cited by Geo News, wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan is considered a leading candidate to replace Azam.With Pakistan set to host the ICC Champions Trophy next year, Akmal questioned the timing of the potential change in leadership.""Why they wanted to bring a change now if they did not do that after losing the Asia Cup, ODI World Cup, and T20 World Cup? What difference does it make [by the way],"" ANI quoted Akmal as saying on Geo News.Pakistan's cricket team faced setbacks under captain Babar Azam last year. In the Asia Cup, they were eliminated in the Super 4 stage after losing to Sri Lanka by two wickets in Colombo. Later, their performance in the ODI World Cup in India also fell short as they failed to make it to the knockout stages.The challenges continued in the T20 World Cup, where Pakistan did not advance past the group stage. They lost their first T20I match against co-hosts USA on a difficult pitch in New York, which was a crucial blow to their campaign.Reflecting on these performances, former cricketer Akmal questioned whether appointing a new captain could improve the team's results.""Is it because the captain is not their favourite, and they want one of their choice? Do you think the new captain will bring Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli , Steve Smith, or Mitchell Starc into the team to boost its performance? If they do not get their basics right, then such blunders will continue to happen, and replacing captains will make no difference. Everyone, including the captain, coach, and selectors, should set their direction right and reform their thinking,"" he suggested.Babar Azam has stepped down as the captain of Pakistan's cricket team in all formats after the team’s early exit from last year's ODI World Cup.Recently, he was reinstated as the captain for the white-ball format, just before the T20 World Cup. This move replaced Shaheen Shah Afridi, who had led Pakistan in a single series against New Zealand, where Pakistan faced a 4-1 series defeat.

The Mariners had taken a two-goal lead but failed to hold onto it.Tiri, one of the ISL 's most experienced foreign players, inadvertently put the ball into his own net in the ninth minute, giving his former team, Mohun Bagan, an early advantage.However, he later redeemed himself by scoring Mumbai City's first goal of the match in the 70th minute.Alberto Rodriguez , participating in his maiden ISL match for Mohun Bagan, propelled the Mariners to a commanding two-goal lead by finding the back of the net in the 28th minute of the game.Mohun Bagan, under the guidance of Jose Molina, found themselves in a familiar situation, unable to hold onto their lead, echoing their loss to NorthEast United FC in the Durand Cup final on August 31 at the same location.Despite the heavy rainfall, Mumbai City FC staged an impressive second-half comeback, with substitute Thaer Krouma finding the equalizer, securing a vital point on the road.The opportunity for Mohun Bagan's Liston Colaco to breach the Mumbai defense arose after the team failed to effectively clear a free kick. Colaco managed to overpower Valpuia and make his way into the penalty area.Subhasish Bose initiated an attack by passing the ball to Colaco on the left flank. Colaco then sent a low cross into the six-yard area, where Mumbai's goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa failed to intercept it. The ball ricocheted off Tiri and ended up in the back of the net, giving Mohun Bagan an early advantage.Mumbai had opportunities to equalize, particularly in the 13th minute when captain Lallianzuala Chhangte delivered an enticing cross from the right, finding Nikolaos Karelis at the far post. However, the striker's mistimed header resulted in a missed chance to level the score.Mohun Bagan extended their lead to 2-0 in the 28th minute, courtesy of a powerful strike from debutant Alberto Rodriguez.After another defensive lapse, Mumbai City once again struggled to clear the ball following a Mohun Bagan corner. Dimitri Petratos recovered the loose ball and passed it to Ashish Rai on the right, who then sent a precise cross into the box.Greg Stewart rose highest at the far post, nodding the ball down into the path of Rodriguez, who calmly slotted home with a side-footed strike to score his first ISL goal.The second half began with Mumbai City pressing for goals, but Manzoro’s wild effort in the 46th minute sailed over the bar.Rodriguez, instrumental in Mohun Bagan's strong first-half performance, went down with a cramp in the 79th minute and had to be substituted. This setback dulled their attacking edge, allowing Mumbai City to seize the momentum.In the 87th minute, Mumbai made key substitutions, bringing on Krouma and Brandon Fernandes.The equalizer came in stoppage time when Krouma finished off a slick move from Noufal in the 90th minute, leveling the score at 2-2.Despite Mohun Bagan's late penalty appeal for a handball and a yellow card for captain Subhasish Bose, Mumbai City's comeback was secured with a dramatic draw.Without regulars like Rahul Bheke, Alberto Noguera, and Jorge Pereyra Diaz, Petr Kratky's Mumbai City FC lined up in a 4-3-3 formation, featuring Chhangte, Bipin, and Nikolaos Karelis upfront.Molina, on the other hand, opted for more midfield strength in a 3-5-2 setup, with Dimitri Petratos and Greg Stewart leading Mohun Bagan's attack.","Mohun Bagan draw 2-2 with Mumbai City FC in the Indian Super League opener in Kolkata on Friday.

Aspirations for the ISL 2024/25 season

NEW DELHI: On August 19, 2024, when Kolkata and the broader Bengal region found themselves gripped by a wave of unrest as countless marches surged through the streets, led by protests demanding justice. It had been less than two weeks since the nation was shaken by the tragic news of a trainee doctor's alleged brutal rape and murder - a chilling crime that sparked outrage and ignited anger across India.Amid the clamour and chaos of the protests, football played its part rather quietly.On that same day, Mohammedan SC (MDSC), who are on the verge of their Indian Super League ( ISL ) debut this season, locked horns with local club Aryan in the Calcutta Football League (CFL). The defending champions, favourites among the two, found themselves trailing early in the match as Aryan snatched a 1-0 lead and maintained it for the entirety of the first half.Mahitosh Roy, a second-half substitute, proved to be the game-changer for the 14-time CFL champions, curling a stunning left-footed strike from outside the box to beat goalkeeper Mainak Akuli in the 51st minute. What followed was more than just jubilation - it was a statement. Roy and his teammates celebrated by waving a jersey with ""Justice for RG Kar "" boldly emblazoned across it. The celebration was the continuation of the Big 3 clubs' unified stand against the heinous crime.That day, Mohammedan won the game 4-1 win, thanks to Israfil Dewan's hat-trick following the equalizer. But beyond the victory on the field, the message was clear: if Mohun Bagan and East Bengal could ignite the fire for justice, Mohammedan were ready to burn just as brightly.""It is a very historical club, established in 1891. We have such a long history, winning so many trophies decades after decades. We had the I-League before ISL; we won the I-League, and now we are in ISL,"" a proud general secretary of MDSC, Ishtiaque Ahmed , told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive conversation from Georgia.Mohammedan SC will kick off their ISL campaign with a high-octane clash against Durand Cup champions NorthEast United FC on September 16.However, the club authorities are extremely pumped up that Mohammedan stand out as a rare supporters-run club in the elite ranks of Indian football. ""I want to point out this is not a corporate club, it's a supporters club. It (qualifying for ISL) was extremely necessary because we have only three massive clubs in Bengal -- it's us, Mohun Bagan, and East Bengal,"" Ahmed added. ""Two of the clubs had already been playing in ISL, now we have also joined in. I want to thank all our supporters and members for this achievement.""Playing in India's top tier brings pride, but it also demands significant funding. Without corporate backing, Mohammedan SC have struggled to piece together the financial puzzle needed to compete at this level.""We entered late in the transfer market because we were facing some issues with our investors. The problem was one investor was hesitant and perhaps was looking for another investor to join our cause. And that's why we entered the market late. Despite these, we already had built a team because we mainly targeted the youngsters,"" Ahmed, famously known as ""Raju"" in Kolkata Maidan, noted.TimesofIndia.com understands that MDSC have spent a staggering sum of Rs 18-20 crore on building the team for the 2024/25 campaign, while their budget for the season, including player signings, food, and lodgings, touches somewhere near Rs 35 crore.Over the summer, Mohammedan SC bolstered their squad with some exciting signings, including forward César Manzoki from the UAE Pro League, who is expected to be a key player in head coach Andrey Chernyshov's plans. They also added promising Indian talents like Gaurav Bora and Amarjit Kiyam to strengthen the team ahead of the ISL campaign.Sources indicate that Chernyshov has been instrumental in shaping the squad, with all transfers—both incoming and outgoing - receiving his final approval, ensuring the team aligns with his vision for the season.""This time, our main focus remains youth development. Some of the players from the reserve squad playing in the CFL (Calcutta Football League) will be playing in the ISL. For example, there is this talented kid Israfil (Dewan). He will be there. Some of the players who were with us in the I-League last season are still with us, and our coach has decided to keep faith in them,"" Ahmed added, emphasizing that players come and go in a club like Mohammedan.""A team cannot rely on just one player. Yes, we had a great combination, that might've gone. But the newcomers will replace the old ones' space,"" Ahmed discussed the club's optimism about the new signings, who are expected to fill the gaps left by Eddie Hernandez and David Lalhansanga, the I-League top-scorer and club's leading Indian goal-scorer last season.The season has certainly begun on a challenging note for Mohammedan SC, with key midfielder Abdul Kadiri Mohammed ruled out for the entire year due to injury. Although the team has some internal options to cover his absence. The club has not understandably looked into the market for his midfield replacement.Having led the club to some excellent results and accolades over the last few years, the Russian manager Chernyshov has earned the full trust and confidence of both the club's authorities and its supporters.Nevertheless, the club remains reluctant to set the bar so high in terms of aspirations for the debut ISL season.Echoing the manager's sentiment of not participating in the ISL just for the sake of it, MDSC general secretary Ahmed remarked, ""I would not say that we would be champions in our first season at the top-tier competition. Yes, it would always be the target to be among the top five best teams in the league.""Making the top five in the ISL team season would require a newcomer like Mohammedan to punch way above their weight. Whether they can muster the momentum needed to achieve this remains a key point of intrigue.","Mohammedan SC (MDSC) are set to make their Indian Super League ( ISL) debut this season. MDSC have spent a staggering sum of Rs 18-20 crore on building the team for the 2024/25 campaign. Their budget for the season, including player signings, food, and lodgings, touches somewhere near Rs 35 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113327816,imgsize-77792,width-400,resizemode-4/113327816.jpg"
"It's time to overhaul AIFF, have a new constitution and conduct fresh elections: Bhaichung Bhutia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/its-time-to-overhaul-aiff-have-a-new-constitution-and-conduct-fresh-elections-bhaichung-bhutia/articleshow/113326485.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bhaichung Bhutia , a renowned figure in Indian football , has strongly criticized the current leadership of the All India Football Federation (AIFF). He attributes the national team's recent poor performances to the AIFF 's mismanagement and lack of vision for the sport in the country.In the recently concluded Intercontinental Cup , a three-nation tournament hosted by India, the national team suffered a devastating 0-3 loss against Syria and could only manage a goalless draw with Mauritius.Bhutia believes that these disappointing results are a direct consequence of the AIFF's failure to establish a clear roadmap for the development of Indian football.The former India captain has called for a complete overhaul of the AIFF administration, emphasizing the need for fresh leadership and a strategic approach to revive the fortunes of the national team. Bhutia's scathing remarks highlight the growing discontent among football enthusiasts and experts regarding the current state of the sport in India.""I think it's not a great sign, we have been on the decline for quite some time now. From being ranked in the top 100 to going down at 125. I think football needs a new governing body and election and a fresh start.""Otherwise, I think it's only going down,"" Bhutia told PTI Videos in an exclusive interview on Friday.""I think there has to be really serious discussion, thorough debate that has to be done for taking the game forward. I think that our constitution has to be reformed, the case is still in the Supreme Court.""I hope the Supreme Court gives a verdict as soon as possible. The federation has to have a new constitution and a new body, a new election has to happen,"" the football legend added.India's lackluster showing in the Intercontinental Cup came on the heels of their inability to progress to the third round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers, even though they had been given a comparatively favorable draw. This series of setbacks ultimately resulted in the dismissal of Igor Stimac, the team's former head coach.Bhutia further said, ""Overall it's time that the federation focuses on how to take Indian football forward. You cannot just have Vision 2046 on paper and not implement things. It is important now that the federation stops doing NGO kind of work,"" Bhaichung observed.""In the last two years the amount of controversies, and allegations happening is so negative for the sport.""I was in an Executive Committee meeting and it was unfortunate to see how we were talking more about how the Bastar region became engulfed in terrorism and nothing about football.""It's great you do a social thing but the federation's primary job is not about doing social things only, it's about performance, getting results from the national team and junior team. So I think it's important we focus there,"" he pointed out.Following the dismissal of Stimac, Manolo Márquez was named the head coach of the Indian men's national team by the AIFF. Márquez concurrently serves as the manager of FC Goa, a club participating in the Indian Super League (ISL).""I am not looking at it, I think in India we need a good set of people coming in, who have a good vision for the game because that is what we require right now.""I quit my politics, in terms of electorate politics, but I am always there to support football. Fight for the presidency is not the main thing.""I think it's time to take the game forward and I think we have good talent at the grassroots, but things are not working out well,"" Bhutia concluded.",Bhaichung Bhutia has strongly criticized the current leadership of the All India Football Federation.

ISL-11 opener: Familiar foes back in business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-11-opener-familiar-foes-back-in-business/articleshow/113308011.cms,"KOLKATA: For a league which is yet to reach its teen and celebrating merely its 11th birthday, the rivalry between Mohun Bagan SG and Mumbai City FC is fast becoming the face of Indian Super League . If there’s one showdown that elevates a match of 90 minutes to a drama of fluctuating fortunes, this is it. If there’s one fixture which always sets two teams at loggerheads with each other raising the bar and gaining a foothold in the title march with all its emotional and volcanic airs, this is it.Their duopoly of last season’s league is still fresh in many minds.If Mohun Bagan pipped Mumbai City to their maiden Winners’ Shield, the Islanders had their revenge on their way to clinching their second ISL Cup, bearding the green-and-maroon lion in their den.However, as the two sides, champions in their own rights, are kick-starting a new season of the league five months down the line, the contest at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday may not be so much about its distinctive, title-defining noise, but both will look to make a I-mean-business statement.Mohun Bagan’s newly-appointed coach Jose Molina, though, is not a man willing to live in the past.“For me, it will be a new match, absolutely different to the last ISL final. We have to work in the present and the only thing that exists in my brain is Mumbai City,” the Spaniard, who once guided now defunct ATK to their ISL title in 2016, told a news conference on Thursday.By Molina’s own admission, Indian football has since changed a lot. So are his Mohun Bagan and rivals Mumbai.New recruit and Australian league all-time leading scorer Jamie Maclaren is yet to complete a full training session with the first team and stays out of reckoning for theISL-11 opener .But it’s not his attack — where his wealth of options is anybody’s envy — where lies a spot of bother. If the Durand Cup is any yardstick, Bagan’s defensive fragility requires immediate attention from the coach.Molina insisted that since all teams are in pre-season mode and yet to be at their best physically, early setbacks should be accepted as an integral part of a learning curve.Mohun Bagan will welcome a fit Spanish centre-back Alberto Rodriguez but Mumbai are capable of testing the home team’s defence with quick wing-play.Petr Kratky’s visitors may have lost Apuia to Bagan in the transfer window, but in Lallianzuala Chhangte, Vikram Partap Singh and newcomer Brandon Fernandes, they have quite a game-changing domestic stars. In Spanish playmaker Jon Toral and Greek attacker Nikos Karelis, they are also building a new side ready to make a mark.Aware of Mumbai’s threat, Molina said: “The plan is to defend as a whole team. We need to defend and attack together and try to see that they don’t have the ball for a long time. Their wingers are dangerous, but they have other players who can be dangerous too.”Unlike in the past, this is sort of a juncture match. Their rivalry now resumes with a tournament-opener but, make no mistake, those old vibes of one-upmanship and competitiveness will be there in plenty to define this contest as well.","Mohun Bagan SG and Mumbai City FC meet in the opening match of the Indian Super League. Bagan won the ISL last season, while Mumbai won their second ISL Cup. Jose Molina's side will welcome a fit Alberto Rodriguez to the Salt Lake Stadium.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113308296,imgsize-73484,width-400,resizemode-4/113308296.jpg"
NEUFC hope for a new beginning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/neufc-hope-for-a-new-beginning/articleshow/113301035.cms,"KOLKATA: In just three days’ time, NorthEast United FC will embark on another Indian Super League campaign with a marquee game against league newcomers Mohammedan Sporting at the Salt Lake stadium here.Yet, the ambience at NEUFC ’s media day at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium in Guwahati had a different feel from the other 10 pre-season interactions. For the club representing the seven northeastern states in India’s top-division football is about to kick off ISL season 11 not on the back of the disappointment that had earlier engulfed the club.They are the Durand Cup champions, scripting a remarkable triumph over giants Mohun Bagan Super Giant in the summit clash, who expect nothing but the best-ever ISL performance and trump the playoffs finishes that had been their best finish so far.However, head coach Juan Pedro Benali does not want his wards to think too much into the future in their quest for the best ISL show.“You’ve got to understand that now the teams that are waiting for us are tougher. They’ll be difficult because before they were saying, ‘we are playing the NorthEast (NEUFC)’ but now they say, ‘NorthEast are coming for us’. They’ll be warned about us. So some games are going to be very good, and some games are going to be very bad. So we’ll wait and see,” Benali said during the media day interactions.“The important thing for us is not to look away. We need to just focus on the coming game. We will finish this one with success and then think of the next away game. If we start thinking too far ahead of us, like winning the Championship or winning the Shield, then we fail. We just need to think about the opening game and nothing else.”And the Spanish coach, with experience of working in four continents, acknowledges the NEUFC setup as the ideal atmosphere that helps its players thrive and go for their goals as a team.“In NEUFC, we are a family comprising the players and staff in the dressing room, those in the office as well as the medics and staff on the field. We are a small but well-knit family. There’s Mandar (Tamhane) looking after all the big and small things. And John Abraham is always aware of everything about the team. That’s why our dressing room is always calm. There’s responsibility, but we can take them on with a fresh mind,” Benali opined.Meanwhile, Mandar Tamhane – the NEUFC CEO with experience of working with Bengaluru FC – spoke of the vision that guides the team forward.“This victory came after 10 long years. So it’s a very proud moment for us. But it’s just a small step and there’s a long way to go for us. The Durand victory has put us on the right track and in a positive mindset. As a club, I think we should win the Championship or the Shield or the Super Cup,” Tamhane explained.Now, it’s time for them to carry forward the momentum from the Durand Cup win and the hopes of seven states in the ISL.","NorthEast United FC will kick off ISL season 11 against Mohammedan Sporting.

Kylian Mbappé wins French league ruling for $61 million in unpaid wages from PSG,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/kylian-mbapp-wins-french-league-ruling-for-61-million-in-unpaid-wages-from-psg/articleshow/113300286.cms,"NEW DELHI: The French league 's legal commission has directed Paris Saint-Germain ( PSG ) to pay Kylian Mbappé 55 million euros ($61 million) in unpaid wages. This information was confirmed by the league on Thursday.Mbappé requested the commission's intervention regarding three months of unpaid salary and a portion of a loyalty bonus after moving to Real Madrid on a free transfer this summer.Talks between PSG officials and Mbappé's representatives occurred in Paris on Wednesday, but Mbappé declined a mediation offer.Following the meeting, Mbappé's representatives told AP that the France striker had asked the commission to take note of the non-payment of three months' salary and the last third of a loyalty bonus.PSG has stated they do not intend to pay the amount and will pursue further legal action.""In light of the limitations of the commission's legal scope to take a complete decision on this matter, the matter must now be contested in another legal forum, to which Paris Saint-Germain is delighted to present all the facts over the coming months and year,"" the club said in a message to the AP.PSG has asserted that it is not obligated to pay the World Cup-winning player under a contract signed when Mbappé was excluded from the squad prior to the 2023-24 season. This exclusion occurred after the player chose not to extend his contract with the club.""As a matter of law and fact, the player has made clear, repeated public and private commitments that must be respected, having been afforded unprecedented benefits by the club over seven years in Paris,"" PSG said after the league's announcement. ""And the club looks forward to these being upheld in the proper forum, if the player seeks to pursue this incomprehensibly reputationally damaging matter further, in due course.""Mbappé's relationship with Paris Saint-Germain ended with significant tension in his final season at the club.PSG felt disappointed after offering Mbappé their most lucrative contract in 2022. Mbappé felt frustrated because, according to him, promises to sign key players were not kept. When he signed the new contract, he held a jersey displaying 2025. Mbappé was reportedly upset by this because the contract was until 2024, with an option for an additional year.In June last year, Mbappé surprised PSG by informing them he would not exercise the option for an extra year. With his contract effectively ending in a year, PSG faced the possibility of having to sell Mbappé to avoid losing him for free when the contract expired.The situation escalated in the summer of 2023. After Mbappé confirmed he would not extend his contract, PSG omitted him from a preseason tour to Japan and South Korea and had him train with fringe players. PSG stated they would prefer to sell him rather than let him leave for free in 2024. However, Mbappé rejected a 300 million euro offer from Saudi team Al-Hilal.PSG initially left Mbappé out of the team's opening league game of that season. Eventually, after ""constructive and positive talks"" between the two parties, PSG allowed Mbappé to return to the lineup.",French league orders PSG to pay Kylian Mbappé 55 million euros ($61 million) in unpaid wages.

If one has to characterise Leo Borg in one word, that would be it.It is one thing handling the pressure that comes with answering to a famous surname, quite another to embrace it and give your best day in and day out — to justify the adulation, to sort of earn the tag, maybe.“It’s a special thing to me to have a dad like him,” Borg said of his father, tennis legend Bjorn Borg , during a video call from his home town Stockholm on Thursday.Sweden host India in a World Group I tie on Saturday and Sunday.“He has done a lot of things in his time, and I feel really blessed because he has all the knowledge I need to get (from a father and a coach).“Of course, he’s been really supportive, and he has always been there for me on the tennis (court) and outside tennis. He’s been the best dad, actually. So I’m pretty, really proud of him, and he has a really special place in my heart.”On the tennis front, there’s no comparison between the father and the son.Borg senior, 68 now, lifted Sweden to its maiden Davis Cup win in 1975 when he was just 19. If his 33 singles win streak is a record in the tournament history, his six French Open trophies — four of them in a row — and five straight Wimbledon titles put him in a different plane altogether.Anyone else, in any walk of life, would have walked away from that borrowed stardom and harsh scrutiny that comes with it. Borg the junior has decided to not only play the sport, but also excel in it.Currently ranked 603, Leo had risen to 334 in the ATP charts last year before suffering a loss of form. He has recovered some of his level and motivation with a title and runner-up finish in the dreary ITF circuit in Thailand in recent weeks, jumping 169 places in the ranking ladder.Leo, 21, put it down to a “simple” advice he received from his father long ago.“Since I was really young, he said, ‘it’s really simple, never stop fighting until the last point’. And that’s been a very good advice, just to fight the whole match and the life outside tennis also. That’s a really simple thing, but it’s been really big.”The youngster’s humble journey on the tennis court may also explain the current woes of the sport in Sweden. For, Sweden is not just the land of Borg, it is also home to Zlatan Ibrahimovic.While Leo, who dabbled in football till the age of 12, had no doubts about his commitment to the racquet sport, his compatriots have quickly gravitated to soccer and other more rewarding sports. Not in them the mettle to fight back from losing the fourth set 16-18 in a tiebreaker after having five match points, and go on to win the fifth set in a Grand Slam final.“In my dad’s time, they had a really good amount of tennis players. I think they had some time like five top-10 players. Now, it’s completely different. We don’t have so many players in Sweden, it’s a little bit sad because we are a really good tennis country,” Leo said.“Many Swedish players quit tennis around the age of 18-19 because they think it’s too hard to get through to the pros. Of course, it’s hard, you really have to fight through to get to the top. I think our mentality has to be better.”","Leo Borg says it is a special thing to have a dad like Bjorn Borg.

Borg the junior has decided to not only play the sport, but also excel in it.Currently ranked 603, Leo had risen to 334 in the ATP charts last year before suffering a loss of form. He has recovered some of his level and motivation with a title and runner-up finish in the dreary ITF circuit in Thailand in recent weeks, jumping 169 places in the ranking ladder.Leo, 21, put it down to a ""simple"" advice he received from his father long ago.""Since I was really young, he said, ‘it's really simple, never stop fighting until the last point'. And that's been a very good advice, just to fight the whole match and the life outside tennis also. That's a really simple thing, but it's been really big.""Amazingly, Leo has not watched videos of his father playing.""I have watched some things, of course, but it's true, I have never searched a video of him or anything like that. Yeah, (it) is funny, I know,"" he smiled.The youngster's humble journey on the tennis court may also explain the current woes of the sport in Sweden. For, Sweden is not just the land of Borg, it is also home to Zlatan.While Leo, who dabbled in football till the age of 12, had no doubts about his commitment to the racquet sport, his compatriots have quickly gravitated to soccer and other more rewarding sports. Not in them the mettle to fight back from losing the fourth set 16-18 in a tiebreaker after having five match points, and go on to win the fifth set in a grand slam final.""In my dad's time, they had a really good amount of tennis players. I think they had some time like five top-10 players. Now, it's completely different. We don't have so many players in Sweden, it's a little bit sad because we are a really good tennis country. I think your mentality is not that good anymore,"" Leo said.""Many Swedish players quit tennis around the age of 18-19 because they think it's too hard to get through pros. Of course, it's hard, you really have to fight through to get to the top. I think out mentality has to be better.""I think we have become too comfort (sic) in our country, to get to the top. So I think we have to focus on the mental side a little bit. Yeah, that's the most important thing, I think, or the difference, from his time.""Tennis is not that big anymore in Sweden, it's not a strange thing, actually, unfortunately.""",Leo Borg is the son of tennis legend Bjorn Borg. The 21-year-old is currently ranked 603 in the ATP rankings. Borg won six French Open titles and five Wimbledon crowns.

India eyes first-ever victory against Sweden in Davis Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/india-eyes-first-ever-victory-against-sweden-in-davis-cup/articleshow/113281433.cms,"NEW DELHI: India is preparing to compete against Sweden in the Davis Cup World Group I contest starting on September 14. Despite having never defeated Sweden in Davis Cup history, the Indian team is hopeful about securing their first victory in their sixth matchup.The contest will take place on a medium-speed indoor court at the Royal Tennis Hall in Sweden. India usually prefers faster surfaces, which would better suit their big servers.Indoor courts typically feature quick ball travel and are unaffected by external factors like wind.The team will play without top players Sumit Nagal and Yuki Bhambri .Former national champion Siddharth Vishwakarma is under consideration to join the team for an upcoming critical match. Despite his skills, his lack of experience at this level might prevent him from playing in a live rubber.The decision will likely consider his potential and the high-pressure nature of the match. His future participation seems contingent on further growth and experience.Captain Rohit Rajpal may opt for doubles specialist Balaji for the singles as he did against Pakistan on grass court earlier this year. In that match, Balaji performed well by defeating veteran Aqeel Khan in Islamabad and is currently in good form in Stockholm.Ramkumar Ramanathan is set to play a key role on the opening day of the upcoming match. The team's decision on the second singles match is still pending, with the choice between Niki Poonacha and N Sriram Balaji.Poonacha, despite his talent, has uncertain fitness due to a recent ankle sprain during practice. He is more focused on doubles and, although he beat Nagal earlier this year in Pune, has not played or won much in singles recently.Elias Ymer, Sweden's top singles player, is currently ranked 238. Indian player Ramkumar has faced Ymer twice on the ATP Tour, securing victories on both occasions.Ramkumar's performance has consistently shown strong talent and skill, yet the key for him is to stay composed under pressure and trust in his abilities.On Sunday, Balaji is set to play doubles. His partner will be either Ramkumar or Poonacha, which will be decided based on the scores after the first day.""We have better servers, and our players like to get in, play shorter points but these are medium-speed courts, so we are getting used to it by playing a lot of singles with each other,"" Rajpal told PTI.""If Yuki and Sumit were here, the tie would have tilted towards us, now it's 50-50.""""Leo Borg (second singles player) has improved a lot, we are watching him. They have a tough doubles team.""In preparation for the upcoming match, India's newly appointed Davis Cup coach, Ashutosh Singh, has conducted thorough research upon his arrival in Stockholm.In preparation for the upcoming competition, Ashutosh engaged with the coaches of the new team members, including Aryan Shah, to understand the young players' mindset and playing style.The Swedish team, led by Borg, holds the 603rd position in the rankings. Their doubles players, Andre Goransson and Filip Bergevi, are formidable competitors, ranked 66 and 125 respectively.Ashutosh engaged in discussions with players who have previously faced Borg to gather valuable insights. Additionally, Ashutosh dedicated a significant amount of time to analysing videos of the opposing players, which will aid in formulating effective strategies.The draw for the event is set to occur on Friday. The first day will feature singles matches, with doubles and reverse singles scheduled for Sunday.The winner of this tie will advance to the Qualifiers next year, while the losing team will move to the World Group I play-offs.","India will play Sweden in the Davis Cup World Group I contest starting on September 14.

PUNE: The Indian Davis Cup team, in Stockholm for the World Group I tie against Sweden on Sep 14-15, had a major fitness concern after Niki Kaliyanda Poonacha hurt his ankle during a practice session.""We had a bit of a scare. Niki Poonacha fell on the centre court, he sprained his ankle.The physios are working with him, he seems to be doing ok,"" captain Rohit Rajpal said from Stockholm on Wednesday. ""There was a spot on the centre court where his shoes got stuck and he fell. We taped it (the ankle), just to protect it.""It happened two days ago. He seems to be better (now), we are going to try him all out today,"" Rapal added, clarifying that the Bengaluru-based pro was put through light practice sessions over the past two days.""It is just a slight strain. He should be alright (in time for the tie)."" Poonacha's fitness is crucial to the Indian team's chances against Sweden in the absence of the country's No. 1 singles player Sumit Nagal as well as top doubles player Yuki Bhambri . Although he is a doubles player predominantly, with the surface playing ""medium"", Poonacha's explosive game with big serves could be an asset in singles.The tie will be played indoors on hard court at the Royal Tennis Hall, which hosts the long-standing Stockholm Open on the ATP Tour. The draw is set for Friday.""He (Poonacha) is one of the choices, certainly. In Poona (Pune Open ATP Challenger) this year, he beat Sumit (Nagal). So he is definitely one of the guys who can rise to the occasion. He is certainly in the fray,"" the captain said of the team's probable lineup for the opening singles.On the doubles pairing, Rajpal said: ""Our No. 1 combination would be our No. 1 doubles player (Sriram) Balaji and Ramkumar, but it all depends on how things shape up on the first day."" The travelling squad also comprises three new faces - former national champion Siddharth Vishwakarma (aged 29, WR 588), Aryan Shah (18, 637) and reserve player Manas Dhamne (16, 1080). Rajpal ruled out giving any of them their maiden India cap on the opening day of the tie. ""We are playing them a lot (in practice sessions), but whether I am going to play them the first day is a big question mark,"" he said.The Swedish team will be spearheaded by former world No. 105 Elias Ymer (now ranked 238) and includes Leo Borg (WR 603), son of legendary Bjorn Borg.

Taylor Fritz

to become 1st Italian man to win US Open

He's 6 ft 3' with a scraggy crown, a face that doesn't say much and legs that are defined to cover great ground, run miles and miles at the speed of lightning. Then there is the intangible. An alloy of the unbendable ilk that runs through Jannik Sinner .The scrutiny the top-seed faced coming into the US Open is hard to imagine. He was fighting questions on his integrity - including some damning ones raised by fellow pros - following two positive tests in March for the banned steroid Clostebol.The 23-year-old was cleared of fault or negligence by an independent tribunal in the week before the season's final Grand Slam, but the court of public opinion, revved up by the engines of social discourse, had turned the glare on him. Players and the public alleged that tennis' anti-doping authorities had treated the world No. 1 differently from other players. At best it was a divided locker room.So, when Sinner threw up his arms up at the end of a power-packed slugfest with American Taylor Fritz, where he had rallied from 3-5 in the third set, reeling off four straight games to seal a dominant win, he stood tall in the winner's circle that isn't for the weak hearted. The world No. 1 took down Fritz, the top-ranked American, 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 to claim his second Grand Slam title of the year, making him the first Italian man to win in New York and also the first man in 47 years to claim his first two Grand Slam titles in the same season.""The pre-tournament circumstances wasn't easy,"" said Sinner, who teared up as he held the Tiffany-designed winner's trophy. ""I felt like I had grown, match by match and that my confidence level went higher and higher (with each match). I'm happy how I handled this one.""Sinner, who surrounded himself with a slim-look team in New York, after dropping physio and fitness coach Giacomo Naldi and Umberto Ferrara from his close circle, had his two coaches - Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi - and girlfriend Anna Kalinskaya , ranked 14 on the WTA Tour, to fall back on.""The people who are close to me daily, people who know me already from when I was very young, my family, my team and everyone who supports me,"" Sinner said of the people who stood by him in the hardest times of his young career. ""I always try to stick with them, especially when the moments are getting difficult and tough, because I know that they can help me in these moments.""Sinner, whose title run in New York has taken his record for the year to 55-5, and extended his winning streak to 11 matches, said he's still sometimes weighed down by the incidents of the last five months.""It was and it's still a little bit in my mind,"" he said. ""My team and people who are close to me, they know what I've been through in the last months. It was not only one week before the tournament. It was months. When I'm on court, I try to focus on the game, I've done a great job mentally staying there, every point I play.""Sinner has now won a Tour-leading six titles in a sparkling 2024 season and has moved him 4,105 points clear of his nearest challenger, German Alexander Zverev .Not since 2002 has a season gone by without tennis' trifecta - Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal - winning a major, which is reason for public debate by itself, but when a pair of pros aged 23 and under in - Carlos Alcaraz , 21, and Sinner - sweep up the Grand Slam calendar, splitting the 2024 haul between them, it's called a new dawn.""It's something new, but it's also nice to see. Nice to see new champions, new rivalries,"" Sinner said. ""I will always have players who are going to make me a better player, because there are going to be times where they beat me. Then you have to try to find a way to win against certain players... it's good for the sport to have some new champions.""Sinner had all the answers in New York City, even when he was pulled wide and away. It's what champions do, they deliver.","Jannik Sinner wins US Open for the first time. Beats Taylor Fritz 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 to claim his second Grand Slam title of the year.
